40916639,Recent advances in single-cell bioinformatics for inferring higher-order chromatin contact maps.,"DNA, a large molecule located in the nucleus, carries essential genetic information, including gene loci and cis-regulatory elements. Despite its extensive length, DNA is compactly stored within the limited space of the nucleus due to its hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) organization. In this structure, DNA is organized into territories known as topologically associated domains (TADs). Within each TAD, numerous chromatin loops link promoters and enhancers across the genome. These loops and the interactions between promoters and enhancers are dynamically regulated, thereby controlling gene transcription activities. With the rapid advancements in single-cell genomics technologies, TAD boundaries and chromatin loops can now be observed at the level of individual cells, allowing researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity in tissues. This review will summarize the state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods recently developed to analyze single-cell Hi-C and epigenomics datasets, which infer higher-order chromatin interactions within the 3D genome. Additionally, we will discuss the biological applications of these tools and future directions for comprehensively investigating epigenomic heterogeneity across different species, developmental stages, and disease states.","Noh, Seung Kyun; Lee, Minhyeok; Jeong, Hyobin","Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Korea.",BMB reports,BMB Rep,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916639,,,,,
40895087,Improving the FAIRness and Sustainability of the NHGRI Resources Ecosystem.,"In 2024, individuals funded by NHGRI to support genomic community resources completed a Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) to evaluate their application of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles and assess their sustainability. By collecting insights from the self-administered questionnaires and conducting personal interviews, a valuable perspective was gained on the FAIRness and sustainability of the NHGRI resources. The results highlighted several challenges and key areas the NHGRI resource community could improve by working together to form recommendations to address these challenges. The next step was the formation of an Organizing Committee to identify which challenges could lead to best practices or guidelines for the community. The workshop's Organizing Committee comprised four members from the NHGRI resource community: Carol Bult, PhD, Chris Mungall, PhD, Heidi Rehm, PhD, and Michael Schatz, PhD. In December 2024, the Organizing Committee engaged with the NHGRI resource community to refine these challenges further, inviting feedback on potential focus areas for a future workshop. This collaborative approach led to two informative webinars in December 2024, highlighting specific challenges in data curation, data processing, metadata tools, and variant identifiers within the NHGRI resources. Throughout the workshop planning process, the four Organizing Committee members worked together to create and develop themes, design breakout sessions, and create a detailed agenda. The workshop's agenda was intentionally structured to ensure participants could generate implementable recommendations for the NHGRI resource community. The two-day workshop was held in Bethesda, MD, on March 3-4, 2025. The challenges received from NHGRI resources were classified into four key categories, forming the basis of the workshop. The four key categories are variant identifiers, data processing, data curation, and metadata tools. They are briefly described below, with greater details on their challenges and recommendations in subsequent sections. Metadata Tools:While metadata is vital for capturing context in genomic datasets, its usage and relevance can vary by domain, making it difficult to standardize usage. While various methods exist for annotating and extracting metadata, incomplete or inconsistent annotations often result in ineffective data sharing and interoperability, further reducing data usability and reproducibility.Data Curation:Curation of annotations for genomics data is critical for FAIR-ness. Scalable curation solutions are challenging because of the multiple components for curation, including harmonizing data sets, data cleaning, and annotation. The workshop focused on identifying which aspects of data curation could be streamlined using computational methods while considering the barriers to increased automation.Variant Identifiers:Variant identifiers are standardized representations of genetic variants, crucial for sharing and interpreting genomic data in research and clinical work. They ensure consistent referencing and enable data aggregation. Standardizing variant identifiers is difficult due to varied formats, complex data, and distinct environments for generating and disseminating data.Data Processing:Data processing is a necessary first step in a FAIR environment. As there are many variant workflows, streamlining this process will ensure greater accuracy, reproducibility, interoperability, and FAIRness, driving advancements in clinical research. The workshop focused on addressing these aspects with a key focus on improvements and best practices around data processing for an NHGRI resource. Several recommendations were made throughout the workshop's interactive sessions with the resources' participants. While many recommendations were specific to data processing, data curation, metadata tools, or variant identifiers, they can be grouped into core recommendations addressing common challenges within the NHGRI resource community. These core recommendations highlight the key themes that emerged across sessions and are listed in the nine recommendations below. Increase transparency to enable effective sharing/reproducibility (documenting, benchmarking, publishing, mapping)Develop entity schema and ontology mapping tools (between models, identifiers, etc.)Annotate tools using resources to increase findability and reuse (Examples: EDAM Ontology of Bioscientific data analysis and data management)Use standard nomenclature and identifiersMake workflows usable by researchers with limited programming expertiseImplement APIs to improve data connectivityPresent data in an interpretable manner, along with machine readabilityDevelop artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) methods for scaling curation processesAssess the impact of resources using an independent group that can assess return on investment and impact to health and scientific advancement. An additional key collaborative outcome was the development of Appendix A, which outlines ongoing and future efforts, including additional workshops, webinars, and meetings through the listed events provided by the NHGRI resource community. We hope that these activities will enable further advances in the implementation of FAIR standards and continue to foster collaboration and exchange across NHGRI resources and the global community.","Babb, Larry; Bult, Carol; Carey, Vincent J; Carroll, Robert J; Hitz, Benjamin C; Mungall, Chris J; Rehm, Heidi L; Schatz, Michael C; Wagner, Alex; NONE, NONE","Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Stanford University, Stanford, CA.; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA.; Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH.; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.",ArXiv,ArXiv,,2025,08,19,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40895087,,,,,
40832044,CAKL: Commutative algebra k-mer learning of genomics.,"Despite the availability of various sequence analysis models, comparative genomic analysis remains a challenge in genomics, genetics, and phylogenetics. Commutative algebra, a fundamental tool in algebraic geometry and number theory, has rarely been used in data and biological sciences. In this study, we introduce commutative algebra k-mer learning (CAKL) as the first-ever nonlinear algebraic framework for analyzing genomic sequences. CAKL bridges between commutative algebra, algebraic topology, combinatorics, and machine learning to establish a new mathematical paradigm for comparative genomic analysis. We evaluate its effectiveness on three tasks-genetic variant identification, phylogenetic tree analysis, and viral genome classification-typically requiring alignment-based, alignment-free, and machine-learning approaches, respectively. Across eleven datasets, CAKL outperforms five state-of-the-art sequence analysis methods, particularly in viral classification, and maintains stable predictive accuracy as dataset size increases, underscoring its scalability and robustness. This work ushers in a new era in commutative algebraic data analysis and learning.","Suwayyid, Faisal; Hozumi, Yuta; Feng, Hongsong; Zia, Mushal; Wee, JunJie; Wei, Guo-Wei","Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University, MI 48824, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University, MI 48824, USA.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223, USA.; Department of Mathematics, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran 31261, KSA.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, MI 48824, USA.",ArXiv,ArXiv,,2025,08,13,2025,09,14,R35 GM148196_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI164266_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832044,,,,,
40799808,Progress and new challenges in image-based profiling.,"For over two decades, image-based profiling has revolutionized cellular phenotype analysis. Image-based profiling processes rich, high-throughput, microscopy data into unbiased measurements that reveal phenotypic patterns powerful for drug discovery, functional genomics, and cell state classification. Here, we review the evolving computational landscape of image-based profiling, detailing current procedures, discussing limitations, and highlighting future development directions. Deep learning has fundamentally reshaped image-based profiling, improving feature extraction, scalability, and multimodal data integration. Methodological advancements such as single-cell analysis and batch effect correction, drawing inspiration from single-cell transcriptomics, have enhanced analytical precision. The growth of open-source software ecosystems and the development of community-driven standards have further democratized access to image-based profiling, fostering reproducibility and collaboration across research groups. Despite these advancements, the field still faces significant challenges requiring innovative solutions. By focusing on the technical evolution of image-based profiling rather than the wide-ranging biological applications, our aim with this review is to provide researchers with a roadmap for navigating the progress and new challenges in this rapidly advancing domain.","Serrano, Erik; Peters, John; Wagner, Jesko; Graham, Rebecca E; Chen, Zhenghao; Feng, Brian; Miranda, Gisele; Kalinin, Alexandr A; Vulliard, Loan; Tomkinson, Jenna; Mattson, Cameron; Lippincott, Michael J; Kang, Ziqi; Sitani, Divya; Bunten, Dave; Seal, Srijit; Carragher, Neil O; Carpenter, Anne E; Singh, Shantanu; Marin Zapata, Paula A; Caicedo, Juan C; Way, Gregory P","Research Program in Systems Oncology, University of Helsinki.; Morgridge Institute for Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison.; Department of Systems Medicine, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE).; Imaging Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.; Bayer AG.; Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh.; Computational Science and Technology, Science for Life Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.; Systems Immunology and Single-Cell Biology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).; Calico Life Sciences.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Colorado School of Medicine.",ArXiv,ArXiv,,2025,08,07,2025,09,14,T15 LM009451_LM_NLM NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM122547_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; T15 LM007359_LM_NLM NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40799808,,,,,
40788209,[Clinical and genetic analysis of a patient with FSIP2 compound heterozygous variants causing multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella].,"The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical features and genetic etiology of a patient with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) retrospectively. A severely oligospermic patient from the Reproductive Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University was selected as the study subject. Clinical data and examination results were collected. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics were used to analyze the genetic etiology. And Sanger sequencing was employed to validate findings in the family. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the sperm ultrastructure, and immunofluorescence analysis was performed to examine the localization of FSIP2 protein in the sperm. The patient presented with severe oligospermia, and sperm morphology displayed MMAF. TEM revealed fibrous sheath and 9+2 microtubule structural disruptions in the sperm. Sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in the FSIP2 gene (c.17798C > T, c.5927T > G), inherited from the father and mother, respectively. According to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the variants were classified as pathogenic. The patient's spouse underwent intracytoplasmic single sperm injection, resulting in one embryo, but no clinical pregnancy occurred after embryo transfer. This study reported the mutation of FSIP2 gene c.17798C > T, c.5927T > G in a patient with MMAF. These findings expand the mutational spectrum of the FSIP2 gene and provide insights for genetic and assisted reproductive counseling for patients with MMAF.","Chen, Yao-Qi; Xu, Li-Qi; Dai, Yi-Bo; Yao, Liang-Yu; Yang, Shen-Ming; Huang, Lu-Yu; Yang, Xi; Yu, Yi; Yang, Jing-Ming; Wu, Ke-Rong","Reproductive Medicine Center, 906 Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Force, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315040, China.; Ningbo Hospital of Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, China.; Center for Reproductive Medicine, the Affiliated Suzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215002, China.; Center for Reproductive Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, China.; Shanghai Weihangsi Biomedical Technology CO.,LTD, Shanghai 201318, China.; Graduate School of Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150040, China.; Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, China.; Department of Urology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315010, China.",Zhonghua nan ke xue = National journal of andrology,Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue,"Humans, Male, Sperm Tail, Heterozygote, Oligospermia, Spermatozoa, Mutation, Infertility, Male, Adult, Pedigree, Retrospective Studies, Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic",2025,08,11,2025,08,24,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40788209,,,,,

We collected the clinical data and results of examinations of a male infertility patient treated in the Women and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University. We analyzed the genetic etiology of the patient by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, verified the pathogenic variants of CCDC114 by Sanger sequencing of the family members, and determined the protein expression of CCDC114 in normal subjects by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. The patient was confirmed with KS-OAS, and found with biallelic variation of CCDC114 (c.71-2A>C, c.816_817insGCAG) by sequencing, which were inherited from father and mother, respectively. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the variants were pathogenic. Two offspring were obtained by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The above findings have broadened the variation spectrum of the CCDC114, and provided some new ideas for genetic and assisted reproduction counseling for patients with Kartagener syndrome.

40791739,Model-Based Causal Discovery for Zero-Inflated Count Data.,"Zero-inflated count data arise in a wide range of scientific areas such as social science, biology, and genomics. Very few causal discovery approaches can adequately account for excessive zeros as well as various features of multivariate count data such as overdispersion. In this paper, we propose a new zero-inflated generalized hypergeometric directed acyclic graph (ZiG-DAG) model for inference of causal structure from purely observational zero-inflated count data. The proposed ZiG-DAGs exploit a broad family of generalized hypergeometric probability distributions and are useful for modeling various types of zero-inflated count data with great flexibility. In addition, ZiG-DAGs allow for both linear and nonlinear causal relationships. We prove that the causal structure is identifiable for the proposed ZiG-DAGs via a general proof technique for count data, which is applicable beyond the proposed model for investigating causal identifiability. Score-based algorithms are developed for causal structure learning. Extensive synthetic experiments as well as a real dataset with known ground truth demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against state-of-the-art alternative methods in discovering causal structure from observational zero-inflated count data. An application of reverse-engineering a gene regulatory network from a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset illustrates the utility of ZiG-DAGs in practice.","Choi, Junsouk; Ni, Yang","Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 98195-4322, USA.; Department of Statistics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 94720-1776, USA.",Journal of machine learning research : JMLR,J Mach Learn Res,,2023,04,21,2025,08,16,R01 GM148974_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40791739,,,,,
40911309,A Payment Incentive to Improve Confirmatory Testing in Men With Prostate Cancer.,"Among men with favorable-risk (ie, low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk) prostate cancer, confirmatory testing substantially improves the detection of aggressive cancers that may merit treatment instead of conservative management. Despite guideline recommendations, confirmatory testing is inconsistently used, and more than half of men do not receive it. Value-based interventions and payment incentives may improve care quality by motivating adherence to guideline-concordant care. To examine the use of confirmatory testing among men with low-risk prostate cancer, after the application of a multifaceted intervention, which included physician education and a payment incentive, sponsored by a commercial payer to support its use. This cohort study used data from the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative on men who received a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer between January 1, 2017, and July 1, 2022, with a minimum 6 months of follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed from October 2024 to June 2025. Multifaceted intervention with a payment incentive, applied specifically to men who received a diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer between April 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019. On meeting the payment incentive's benchmark (ie, ≥45% of men with low-risk prostate cancer complete confirmatory testing within 6 months of diagnosis), the insurer would distribute enhanced reimbursement on claims covered by commercial preferred provider organization plans. Confirmatory testing completion (ie, magnetic resonance imaging before or after diagnostic biopsy, repeat prostate biopsy, or genomics test) relative to the preincentive period among men with low-risk prostate cancer. Secondary analyses examined practices by baseline confirmatory testing completion and proportion of patients with insurance plans covered by the insurer sponsoring the payment incentive. The study included 6609 patients (median age, 65 years [IQR, 60-70 years]), of whom 72.9% (n = 4818) elected for active surveillance. Confirmatory testing increased between 2017 (44.6% [725 of 1625]) and 2022 (64.3% [774 of 1203]) (P < .001). During the payment incentive period, patients had a 7.5% (95% CI, 0.0%-15.4%; P = .06) increase in the predicted probability of confirmatory testing completion relative to the preincentive period, although this change was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.99-2.09]; P = .06). In this cohort study of men with prostate cancer, confirmatory testing completion improved over the study period. However, the payment incentive was not associated with a robust increase in its use. The results suggest collaboration between payers and physicians has the potential to improve measures of prostate cancer care quality, but also highlight the challenges associated with payment incentives and alternative payment model implementation.","Srivastava, Arnav; Kaufman, Samuel R; Shay, Addison; Oerline, Mary; Liu, Xiu; Chachlani, Preeti; Guro, Paula; Hill, Dawson; Van Til, Monica; Linsell, Susan; Labardee, Corinne; Dall, Christopher; Faraj, Kassem S; Maganty, Avinash; Ghani, Khurshid R; Borza, Tudor; Ginsburg, Kevin B; Hollenbeck, Brent K; Shahinian, Vahakn B","Department of Urology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.; Dow Division of Health Services Research, Department of Urology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.; Department of Urology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.",JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,"Humans, Male, Prostatic Neoplasms, Reimbursement, Incentive, Middle Aged, Aged, Cohort Studies, Michigan, Guideline Adherence, Motivation",2025,09,02,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40911309,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.30624,40911309,0,0,NONE
40838279,Transcriptional regulation of neuropeptide receptors underlies context-dependent adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Neuropeptides (NPs) and their receptors (NPRs) play critical roles in modulating physiological processes and behaviors across species. While the transcriptional regulation of NP genes has been extensively studied, how NPRs contribute to context-dependent behavioral plasticity remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the genomic features and expression patterns of NPRs in Drosophila melanogaster, leveraging comparative genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), transcription factor (TF) network analysis, and empirical validation to uncover the regulatory mechanisms that involve NPRs and play roles in context-dependent adaptation. We demonstrate that NPR genes exhibit more complex cis-regulatory landscapes, with greater numbers of enhancers compared to NP genes. Also, NPRs are regulated via a broader network of TFs, particularly in response to environmental and physiological cues such as temperature shifts. Through analysis of scRNA-seq data and qRT-PCR, we show that the expression level of NPRs is dynamically modulated in a context-dependent manner, while NP levels remain relatively stable. This ""NPR-biased"" gene regulation is evident across diverse combinations of NP-NPR pairs, with a distinct pattern of TF control in the head and body of D. melanogaster. Furthermore, the expression level of NPR genes increases during aging of the fly, suggesting a key role in aging and developmental processes. Our findings highlight the importance of NPR transcriptional control in shaping neuropeptidergic signaling and adaptive behaviors.","Ryu, SeungHeui; Wei, Yanan; Wu, Zekun; Zhang, Tianmu; Lee, DoHoon; Najafi, Hadi; Kim, Woo Jae","Department of Information Convergence Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, Korea.; The HIT Center for Life Sciences, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.; Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.; Medical and Health Research Institute, Zhengzhou Research Institute of HIT, Zhengzhou, China.",FEBS open bio,FEBS Open Bio,,2025,08,21,2025,08,21,NONE_NONE_Harbin Institute of Technology_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40838279,10.1002/2211-5463.70107,40838279,0,0,NONE
40883955,Practice Recommendations for Genetic Testing of Ataxias.,"Over the past decade, significant advances in genetic testing for ataxia have improved diagnostic accuracy, informed clinical trial eligibility, guided treatment decisions, and enabled cascade testing of at-risk relatives. While guidance exists for other neurogenetic conditions, there are no standardized guidelines on genetic counseling and testing for individuals with unexplained ataxia. We conducted a comprehensive literature review on genetic counseling and testing in ataxia, identifying 7362 articles. After removing 2971 duplicates, 4391 articles were screened by two authors using the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) framework. In areas lacking clear published evidence, we convened a multidisciplinary expert panel with clinical and genetic expertise in ataxia. Following conflict resolution and additional filtering, 68 articles were included in our guidance development. Based on this evidence and expert consensus, we developed 20 recommendations addressing indications for genetic testing in hereditary ataxia, components of pre- and post-test counseling, testing options, insurance considerations, interpretation of test results, and appropriate referral to genetic counseling services. Major themes include the importance of formal genetic counseling and suggesting whole genome sequencing as first-line testing, with an emphasis on detecting repeat expansions. These evidence-based, consensus-driven recommendations aim to support clinicians in evaluating patients with unexplained ataxia in order to provide timely evaluation and care, both for patients and their at-risk relatives.","Srinivasan, Sharan R; Mook, Amy D; Rochman, Michelle; Chen, Jin Yun Helen; Mu, Weiyi; Wilmot, George R; Rosenthal, Liana S; Uhlmann, Wendy R","Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Neurology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Department of Neurology, Mass General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,,2025,08,29,2025,08,30,NONE_NONE_University of Michigan_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883955,10.1002/acn3.70171,,,,
40789080,Comprehensive Genetic Map of Muscle Lipidome Reveals Novel Insights Into Flavor Variation in Ruminant Meat.,"Ruminant meat is an important component of human diets, valued for its unique flavor and nutritional density. Lipids play a dominant role in shaping meat flavor, yet their genetic and biochemical basis remains unexplored. Here, from the analysis of 434 sheep longissimus thoracis samples, the current study presents the first comprehensive lipid map of sheep meat, including 947 lipids. A substantial proportion of these lipids exhibit moderate-to-high heritability, with 51.6% surpassing a heritability of 0.2 and 15.8% exceeding 0.45. Metabolome-based genome-wide association analysis identifies 467 significant loci affecting 233 lipids, including 110 loci exhibiting pleiotropy. Notably, the levels of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols containing oleic (C18:1) and linoleic (C18:2) acids are specifically regulated by the expression of MBOAT1 and PAQR8 genes, respectively, while 13 triglycerides and one diglyceride are co-regulated by SH2D4A. The levels of phosphatidylethanolamine PE(20:4_20:0) are regulated by VPS53. Further examination of volatile compounds demonstrates that variations in these genetically controlled lipids significantly impact flavourant levels in cooked meat. Given the conservation of lipid profiles and genomes among ruminants, this study offers novel insights into the genetic architecture underlying meat lipid metabolism and provides a valuable resource for the targeted genetic improvement of ruminant meat flavor.","Zhang, Xueying; Kong, Yuanyuan; Chen, Jialei; Li, Ran; Wang, Zhongyu; Song, Yali; Dai, Tianshu; Fu, Yuxin; Jiang, Beixiang; Zeng, Jize; Pei, Shengwei; Liu, Yangkai; Feng, Qianjie; Fu, Weiwei; Yuan, Zehu; Mwacharo, Joram Mwashigadi; Li, Fadi; Yue, Xiangpeng","Joint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-Product Safety of Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, 225000, China.; Animal and Veterinary Sciences, Scotland's Rural College, Roslin Institute Building, Edinburgh, EH25 9RG, Scotland.; Dryland Livestock Genomics, International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Addis Ababa, 5689, Ethiopia.; State Key Laboratory of Herbage Improvement and Grassland Agro-Ecosystems, College of Pastoral Agriculture Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, 730000, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shanxi, 712100, China.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",Adv Sci (Weinh),,2025,08,11,2025,08,11,32 072 713_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 202105_NONE_Precision Identification Project of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources_; CARS-38_NONE_Earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System_; 2024M751265_NONE_China Postdoctoral Science Foundation_; 24JRRA440_NONE_Gansu Youth Science and Technology Fund Program_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40789080,10.1002/advs.202506900,40789080,0,,
40788127,Integration of Genetic and Imaging Data for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Interpretation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex interactions between genetic risk factors and structural brain changes. Traditional diagnostic approaches that rely on single-modality data, such as imaging or genomics alone, often fall short in both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To address these limitations, AlzCLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework that integrates single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles and MRI-derived imaging features into a unified embedding space is introduced. This joint representation captures disease-relevant interactions between genetic variation and brain structure, enabling both accurate diagnosis and mechanistic insight into AD. AlzCLIP is trained and evaluated on two large-scale cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the UK Biobank (UKB), and demonstrated robust diagnostic performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 19%. More importantly, the model yields interpretable outputs through feature importance and interaction analyses, identifying key contributors to AD risk, including rs1135173, rs7575209, and rs66763080, as well as structural markers such as hippocampal volume and precuneus surface area. Notably, AlzCLIP uncovered genotype-specific effects on imaging phenotypes.

40801285,Non-Random Distribution of EMS-Induced Mutations Reveals Preference for Open Chromatin and Expressed Genes in Rice.,"Mutagenesis is an effective strategy to generate genetic resources for functional genomics and crop improvement. It is widely accepted that chemical-induced mutations are randomly distributed across the genome. However, the randomness of such mutations remains a matter of scientific debate due to a lack of systematic investigation. Although the basic features of mutations induced by different mutagens are known, it remains unresolved whether these mutations correlate with the chromatin state and gene expression. In this study, genomes of the wild-type and 4,619 mutagenized M3 lines derived from treatment with two concentrations of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) are sequenced, identifying over 7 million single-nucleotide mutations (SNP<sup>m</sup>s) that covered over 97% of genes in the rice genome. Comprehensive analyses integrated with genomic, epigenomic, and expression data revealed that SNP<sup>m</sup>s are more frequently located in open chromatin regions and actively expressed genes. Within expressed genes, heterozygous SNP<sup>m</sup>s are enriched both upstream and downstream of transcription start sites (TSSs), whereas homozygous SNP<sup>m</sup>s are enriched significantly in the upstream regions. These findings demonstrate that EMS-induced mutations are non-randomly distributed across the rice genome, with a preference for functionally important genomic regions.","Yao, Xue-Feng; Liu, Yanhong; Li, Zhiyong; Jiang, Guo-Qiang; Wang, Wensheng; Lu, Hong; Li, Huihui; Lu, Zefu; Liu, Chun-Ming","State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Resources and Breeding, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.; School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, 100091, China.; Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, State Key Laboratory of Forage Breeding-by-Design and Utilization, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.; China Golden Marker Co., LTD, Beijing, 102206, China.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",Adv Sci (Weinh),,2025,08,13,2025,08,13,NONE_NONE_Outstanding Young Scientist Foundation_; NONE_NONE_Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Young Talent Scientist Program_; 2016ZX08009001006_NONE_National Transgenic Research Projects of China_; 32230077_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) of China_; XDA24010402_NONE_Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences_; 2025KYPT0159_NONE_Projects of Key Laboratory of Rice Breeding Innovation in Northern Cold Region of Inner Mongolia in China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40801285,10.1002/advs.202510034,40801285,0,,

Blood samples from study participants are separated into fractions and transported to the African Coordinating Centre (ACC: Ibadan, Nigeria), where DNA extraction and long-term biospecimen storage are carried out. Plasma and DNA aliquots are shipped to the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami (HIHG-UM, Miami, USA) for genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and biomarker analysis. Innovative solutions were devised to mitigate challenges encountered so far. Our biobanking experience in a low-resource setting demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a successful African biobanking network, as an important infrastructure to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: Biobanking is gaining grounds in Africa in studies related to neurological disorders. The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) biobanking network is a new initiative to enhance infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa through the African Dementia Consortium. The processes of the stepwise creation and development of the READD-ADSP biobanking network have been guided by global best practices and regulatory standards. Challenges were encountered in the process of establishing the READD-ADSP biobank, and home-grown solutions were developed to mitigate the challenges. The READD-ADSP biobanking experience offers lessons to researchers in low-resource settings on how collaborative efforts between the global north and global south enhance cutting-edge team science to tackle ageing-associated brain disorders in low- and middle-income countries.","Akinwande, Kazeem Sanjo;

40905590,Topology-Engineered Guide RNAs for Programmable Control of CRISPR/Cas Activity.,"CRISPR/Cas systems have transformed genome editing, yet achieving precise temporal and conditional control remains challenging. Traditional strategies involving linear guide RNAs (gRNAs) modified with multiple chemical groups throughout their strands often face limitations such as heterogeneous reaction outcomes, irreversibility, and variable editing efficiencies. To overcome these issues, topology-engineered guide RNAs (TE-gRNAs) have emerged, featuring defined structural architectures including polymeric, circular, and dendrimer-like topologies that enable precise spatial control, reversibility, and programmable activation of CRISPR activity. By selectively incorporating physical or chemically responsive linkers and stimuli-sensitive groups at specific sites, TE-gRNAs facilitate dynamic and conditional genome editing that can be activated or deactivated with external triggers such as light or chemical signals. These engineered RNA structures significantly improve synthesis feasibility, stability, reduce off-target effects, and provide unprecedented control over gene editing processes. Recent advancements in TE-gRNAs demonstrate their broad applicability in synthetic biology, functional genomics, and therapeutic interventions, highlighting their potential to achieve precise spatiotemporal modulation of CRISPR systems. This review summarizes the current strategies, benefits, and challenges associated with TE-gRNAs, and discusses future directions for enhancing their performance and utility in complex genome editing applications.","Cheng, Liang","Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Recognition and Function, CAS Research/Education Center for Excellence in Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,,2025,09,04,2025,09,04,2025YFA0920900_NONE_National Key R&D Program of China_; BNLMS-CXTD-202401_NONE_Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences_; 22537005_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; XDB0960103_NONE_Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905590,10.1002/anie.202511756,40905590,0,0,NONE
40883224,TCS-TP: Transporter Protein Prediction Based On Multi-Scale Feature Extraction.,"Transporter proteins play a crucial role in maintaining ionic homeostasis inside and outside the cell, facilitating protein uptake, and enabling cellular communication with the external environment. Transporter proteins (TPs) are also significant targets for medical research and drug development. Accurately predicting novel TPs remains a major challenge in functional genomics. In this study, we propose TP prediction models, designated as TCS-TP, that utilize transformer and convolutional neural networks for multi-scale feature extraction of protein sequences. The transformer incorporates the GLU activation function, whereas the convolutional neural network (CNN) features three parallel subnetworks. Support vector machines are used as a classifier for TP classification. The test results demonstrate that TCS-TP could successfully recognize TPs, with AUROC of 0.89, AUPRC of 0.81, and accuracy of 91.6617%. Upon further comparison, it is determined that TCS-TP outperforms other methods. We hoped that TCS-TP will prove to be a valuable tool for predicting TPs in large-scale genomic projects and contribute to the discovery of new TPs.","Yu, Fan; Zheng, Qianying; Fu, Qingwei; Chen, Jiansen","Fujian Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Technology for Precision Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China.; College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China.; Department of Nosocomial Infection Control, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.",Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,,2025,08,29,2025,08,29,NONE_NONE_Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology Key Industry Guidance Project_; NONE_NONE_Fujian Province Joint Funds for the Innovation of Science and Technology_; NONE_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883224,10.1002/bab.70041,,,,

40916483,Causal Effects of Inflammatory Cytokines on Bipolar Disorder: A Bidirectional Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Inflammatory cytokine disturbance is a prominent outcome of immune dysregulation, extensively documented in bipolar disorder (BD). However, observational studies have exhibited inconsistent findings, and the causal relationships between inflammatory factors and BD remain unclear. Hence, this study aimed to uncover the causality between circulating inflammatory cytokines and BD. In the bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, two genetic instruments derived from a publicly available genomic dataset were utilized. Genetic variant data for 41 inflammatory cytokines were obtained from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies involving 8293 Finnish individuals. BD data included 41,917 cases and 371,549 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Database. To estimate causal connections between inflammation cytokines and BD, we performed five methods: inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate robustness, including tests for heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and leave-one-out validation. In the IVW approach, we identified significant associations between genetic liability to elevated levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), and monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP-3) with increased risk of developing BD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.119, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.021-1.226, p = 0.016; OR = 1.084, 95% CI = 1.002-1.174, p = 0.044; OR = 1.060, 95% CI = 1.001-1.122, p = 0.046, respectively). Across the various MR methods employed, the directions of causal inferences remained consistent. However, reverse MR analysis revealed no significant evidence for causal effects of genetic predisposition to BD on inflammatory cytokines. Our findings provide robust genetic evidence supporting causal effects of elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines on BD, conferring a high susceptibility to BD. Our study emphasizes that interventions aimed at reducing peripheral inflammatory cytokine levels should be prioritized in BD management.","Cheng, Ying; Wang, Meiti; Fang, Yu; Xu, Jinjie; Zheng, Jinxin; Ju, Peijun; Chen, Jianhua","Department of Nephrology, Ruijin Hospital, Institute of Nephrology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Shanghai Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Mental Health, Shanghai, China.; School of Global Health, Chinese Center for Tropical Diseases Research, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Xinjiang, China.; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Psychotic Disorders, Shanghai, China.; Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.",Brain and behavior,Brain Behav,"Humans, Bipolar Disorder, Mendelian Randomization Analysis, Cytokines, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Inflammation, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2025,09,07,2025,09,11,23ZR1454600_NONE_Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai_; 2023-YJ12_NONE_Shanghai Mental Health Center General Projects_; 82071500_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 2021-YJ02_NONE_Shanghai Mental Health Center General Projects_; SZB2023204_NONE_Open Project Funded by the Shanghai Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Mental Health_; 2023-TX-018_NONE_TCCI Frontier Lab for AI and Mental Health-Shanghai Mental Health Center_; YG2025QNA47_NONE_Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916483,10.1002/brb3.70796,40916483,0,0,NONE
40891182,Exploring the Causal Links Between 338 Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolites and Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor impairments and intricate pathophysiological mechanisms. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites are viewed as potential biomarkers, the primarily observational design of the majority of existing studies limits the ability to draw causal conclusions. The purpose of this research was to explore the causal link between CSF metabolites and PD by employing two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR). Data on CSF metabolites were acquired from the two longitudinal cohort studies. Information regarding PD was gathered from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium. Instrumental variables (IVs) for 338 CSF metabolites were identified based on notable SNPs. Causal impacts were assessed using Mendelian randomization techniques including inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis and MR-Egger regression. The analyses included sensitivity assessments to evaluate issues related to heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Significant causal associations were found between several CSF metabolites and PD. Higher levels of glycerophosphoinositol, sphingomyelin, and oxalate were linked to increased PD risk, while elevated caffeine levels appeared protective. After FDR correction, glycerophosphoinositol, oxalate, and caffeine remained significant. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness with no heterogeneity or pleiotropy. This analysis of MR reveals multiple CSF metabolites that have causal links to PD. Increased levels of glycerophosphoinositol and oxalate are associated with higher risk, whereas caffeine provide protective benefits. These metabolites may act as potential biomarkers and treatment targets for PD.","Zhang, Houwen; Li, Chunrong; Yu, Jialin; Liang, Yu; Wu, You; Cao, Fangzheng","Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Department of Neurology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; The Second Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.",Brain and behavior,Brain Behav,"Humans, Parkinson Disease, Mendelian Randomization Analysis, Biomarkers, Male, Longitudinal Studies, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Female, Aged, Middle Aged",2025,09,02,2025,09,05,82205012_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) - Young Scientists Fund_; 2021KY841_NONE_Zhejiang Province Medical and Health Science and Technology Program_; 2022KY929_NONE_Zhejiang Province Medical and Health Science and Technology Program_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40891182,10.1002/brb3.70815,40891182,0,0,NONE
40785195,Family History of Hypertension Predicts Thyroid Cancer Risk in Women: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study With Integrative Machine Learning and Genomic Analyses.,"Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine malignancies globally, with a markedly higher incidence in women. Although pregnancy-induced hypertension is recognized as a risk factor, the underlying mechanisms linking hypertension and thyroid cancer remain poorly understood. This study explores the gender-specific associations between family history of hypertension and thyroid cancer, integrating clinical characteristics with genetic insights. In this large-scale cross-sectional study conducted in China, clinical and lifestyle data were collected from 52,963 participants, including 296 thyroid cancer cases. An interpretable ensemble machine learning model was constructed to evaluate risk factors, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied to identify significant hypertension-related genes, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare overall survival, clinical stages, and immune cell infiltration between high- and low-risk groups. Our analysis revealed that individuals with a family history of hypertension exhibited a significantly altered rate of thyroid cancer (p < 0.001). In particular, among women, a positive family history increased thyroid cancer risk (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.09-2.14, p = 0.04) and emerged as a key predictor in the machine learning model. Genetic analyses identified overlapping genes-most notably FOXD3, F10, and SLC12A5-whose aberrant expression was associated with poorer five-year survival and distinct immune cell profiles. Our study provides novel clinical and genetic evidence that family history of hypertension is significantly associated with thyroid cancer in women. Integrating hypertension-related screening with genetic profiling may enhance risk stratification and aid in the development of personalized management strategies to reduce overtreatment.","Wang, Zijin; Lin, Yanhui; Meng, Fanke; Sun, Yuxin; Zhang, Ziran; Wu, Tong; Fu, Min; Wu, Fanye; Li, Zhengran; Chen, Zejun","The Second Clinical Medicine School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.; Health Management Center, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Emergency Department, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.; Department of Ophthalmology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.; The First Clinical Medicine School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,"Humans, Female, Machine Learning, Cross-Sectional Studies, Hypertension, Thyroid Neoplasms, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Adult, China, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genomics, Male, Aged, Medical History Taking",2025,08,08,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40785195,10.1002/cam4.71031,40785195,1,,[40785195]

We assembled a 2.52 Gb draft genome for <i>B. hypoxanthus</i> with 202,243 contigs (N50 = 29,134 bp), and BUSCO analyses indicated 52% completeness and 15.5% fragmented genes. The complete 16,635 bp mitochondrial genome retains the conserved mammalian structure with 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, 13 CDS, and an origin of replication. Additionally, we designed 31 SSR primer pairs suitable for non-invasive sampling and genotyping, alongside two mtDNA and two sex-determination primers, configured into three multiplex PCR sets. These genomic resources, including the draft genome, complete mitochondrial genome, and microsatellite markers, provide essential tools for evolutionary analyses and the genetic monitoring of <i>B. hypoxanthus</i> populations, supporting its conservation.","de Melo-Ximenes, Amanda Alves; Batista, Romina; Corvalán, Leonardo Carlos Jeronimo; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Kuderna, Lukas; Farh, Kyle; Rogers, Jeffrey; Kaizer, Mariane da Cruz; Boubli, Jean Philippe; de Melo, Fabiano Rodrigues; Nunes, Rhewter; Telles, Mariana Pires de Campos","Departamento de Engenharia Florestal Universidade Federal de Viçosa Viçosa Minas Gerais Brazil.; Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas USA.; Escola de Ciências Médicas e da Vida Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Goiás Goiânia Goiás Brazil.; Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden.; Laboratório de Bioinformática e Biodiversidade (LBB), Instituto Acadêmico de Ciências da Saúde e Biológicas (IACSB) Universidade Estadual de Goiás - Campus Oeste - UnU de Iporá Iporá Goiás Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, INPA Manaus Amazonas Brazil.; Instituto Nacional da Mata Atlântica Santa Teresa Espírito Santo Brazil.; Laboratório de Genética & Biodiversidade Instituto de Ciências Biológicas I, Universidade Federal de Goiás Goiânia Goiás Brazil.; School of Science, Engineering and the Environment, University of Salford Salford England UK.; Rede Eco-Diversa Para Conservação da Biodiversidade Tombos Minas Gerais Brazil.; Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre University of Gothenburg Gothenburg Sweden.; Institut de Biologia Evolutiva, Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona Spain.; Illumina Inc.

40785993,Conservation Implications for the Iberian Narrow Endemic <i>Androsace cantabrica</i> (Primulaceae) Using Population Genomics With Target Capture Sequence Data.,"<i>Androsace cantabrica</i> (Losa & P. Monts.) Kress is a narrow endemic alpine plant restricted to a few high-elevation localities in the Cantabrian Mountains of northern Spain. Although currently accepted as a distinct species, its close morphological and phylogenetic affinity to related taxa such as <i>Androsace adfinis</i> and <i>Androsace halleri</i> has led to historical uncertainty about its taxonomic status and evolutionary origin. Here, we use the universal Angiosperms353 target capture kit to generate nuclear and plastid data from <i>A. cantabrica</i> and closely related species in section <i>Aretia</i>. We employ phylogenomic analyses to clarify species boundaries and population genomic analyses to inform conservation management, as well as flow cytometry and sequence-based analysis using allelic frequencies to estimate its ploidy level. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear loci support <i>A. cantabrica</i> as a monophyletic clade, distinct from both <i>A. adfinis</i> and the <i>A. halleri</i> and <i>Androsace laggeri</i> clades, although topological incongruence with plastid data suggests historical hybridization. Flow cytometry and allelic frequency-based analysis indicate that <i>A. cantabrica</i> is tetraploid, differentiating it from <i>A. halleri</i> and <i>A. laggeri</i>, which are diploid. Population structure analyses reveal a shallow genetic split between eastern and western groups (<i>F</i> <sub>ST</sub> = 0.04485), with higher genetic diversity observed in the east. We estimated the species' distribution, population sizes, and threats, and classified it as Vulnerable under IUCN criteria B1ab(ii,iii) + 2ab(ii,iii). We recommend targeted in situ management, <i>ex situ</i> seed conservation, and the establishment of a micro-reserve. This study illustrates the utility of Angiosperms353 data for resolving both taxonomic questions and conservation strategies in polyploid, range-restricted species.","Liang, Ke Jungle; Shepherd-Clowes, Amelia; Agut, Agustí; Hidalgo, Oriane; Tejero Ibarra, Pablo; Viruel, Juan","Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) University of Amsterdam Amsterdam the Netherlands.; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Richmond UK.; Banco de germoplasma del Jardín Botánico de Olarizu Vitoria-Gasteiz Spain.; Institut Botànic de Barcelona (IBB) CSIC-CMCNB Barcelona Spain.; Aranzadi Zientzia Elkartea Donostia Spain.; Instituto Pirenaico de Ecología (IPE-CSIC) Jaca Huesca Spain.",Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,08,08,2025,08,13,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40785993,10.1002/ece3.71901,40785993,0,,
40900724,A Prelude to Conservation Genomics: First Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly of a Flying Squirrel (Pteromyini: <i>Pteromys volans</i>).,"The Siberian flying squirrel (<i>Pteromys volans</i>) represents the only European Pteromyini species. Thus, it is biogeographically unique due to its specialised anatomy and biology as a volant rodent. As a result of habitat fragmentation and destruction, Siberian flying squirrels experience severe and ongoing population declines throughout most of their distribution. While considered <i>Least Concern</i> throughout their immense Eurasian distribution, this species is red-listed as <i>Vulnerable</i> and even <i>Critically Endangered</i> in parts of its range. More knowledge about the population structure and overall biology is needed to improve conservation efforts for this umbrella and flagship species of old-growth boreal forests. Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of any Pteromyini, represented by <i>P. volans</i> (Uoulu_pteVol_1.0). The final assembly has a total length of 2.85 Gbp in 19 chromosome-scale scaffolds with only minor differences in the chromosomal structure compared to other Sciuridae. All chromosome-scale scaffolds show indications for telomeres at both ends; the N50 value and busco as well as <i>k</i>-mer completeness scores are high with 157.39 Mbp and 97%-99%, respectively, indicating chromosome-level quality of the assembly. Based on whole-genome data from 17 rodent species, <i>P. volans</i> clusters according to known evolutionary relationships. Additionally, we present a new 16,511 bp long mitogenome unveiling differences from known conspecific mitogenomes. We propose the utility of the new reference genome for further research and development of conservation-applied genetic methods. Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of any flying squirrel species (Pteromyini), specifically from the nominate subspecies of the Siberian flying squirrel (<i>Pteromys volans volans</i>). While overall considered to be of <i>Least Concern</i> by the IUCN, this species shows drastically declining trends in most of their distribution and is even threatened by extinction in some countries. Many studies pointed out that a genomic approach is needed to tackle current study questions comprehensively. Therefore, the novel chromosome-level genome assembly should serve as a reference for research of the species' ecology and evolution as well as for the development of genetic tools for conservation management.","Wehrenberg, Gerrit; Kiebler, Angelika; Greve, Carola; Beltrán-Sanz, Núria; Ben Hamadou, Alexander; Meißner, René; Winter, Sven; Prost, Stefan",Centro di Ateneo Orto Botanico University of Padua Padua Italy.; Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (LOEWE-TBG) Frankfurt am Main Germany.; Senckenberg Forschungsinstitut Und Naturmuseum Frankfurt am Main Germany.; Faculty of Science and Technology University of the Faroe Islands Tórshavn The Faroe Islands.; Research Institute of Wildlife Ecology University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna Austria.; Central Research Laboratories Natural History Museum Vienna Vienna Austria.; Ecology and Genetics Research Unit University of Oulu Oulu Finland.; Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre Frankfurt am Main Germany.,Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,09,01,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40900724,10.1002/ece3.71905,40900724,0,0,NONE
40785999,Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetics of Chloroplasts Reveal Lower Rates of Genetic Variation in Mango (<i>Mangifera</i>).,"The mango is an important economic crop with a long history of cultivation. However, studies on the characteristics among chloroplast (cp) genomes and the phylogenetic relationships of different mango varieties are still limited. To fill this research gap, we assembled, annotated, and compared the cp genomes of 23 mango germplasms. The mango cp genome exhibited a typical quadripartite structure, ranging in length from 157,604 to 158,949 bp. Each sequence encoded 129 genes, including 84 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Nucleotide diversity analysis identified three mutation hotspot regions, <i>trn</i>H-GUG-<i>psb</i>A, <i>ycf</i>4-<i>cem</i>A, and <i>ndh</i>F-<i>rpl</i>32, which could be used to develop chloroplast-specific markers. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that mango germplasm can be divided into four major clades, with wild and cultivated varieties forming independent clades. Interestingly, comparative chloroplast genomics and phylogenetics revealed a relatively low rate of genetic variation among cultivated mangoes. This phenomenon may be attributed to extensive interspecific hybridization and gene introgression events during mango domestication. This study provides valuable genomic resources for crop breeding and enhances our understanding of the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships among different mango varieties.","Li, Chuanning; Huang, Jianfeng; Wei, Zuan; Gao, Yuzu; Yisilam, Gulbar; Zheng, Enting; Jiao, Fangfang; Chu, Zhenzhou; Su, Ying; Liao, Caihua; Lei, Xuefen; Nong, Jinyu; Liang, Yonghai; Lin, Juanyan; Wei, Yingman; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Qiuyan; Tian, Xinmin","Key Laboratory of Ecology of Rare and Endangered Species and Environmental Protection (Ministry of Education) & Guangxi Key Laboratory of Landscape Resources Conservation and Sustainable Utilization in Lijiang River Basin College of Life Science, Guangxi Normal University Guilin China.; National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences Haikou China.; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Genetic Engineering, College of Life Science and Technology Xinjiang University Urumqi China.; Guangxi University Engineering Research Center of Bioinformatics and Genetic Improvement of Specialty Crops, College of Life Science Guangxi Normal University Guilin China.; Guangxi Subtropical Research Institute Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences Nanning China.",Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,08,08,2025,08,13,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40785999,10.1002/ece3.71957,40785999,0,,
40909018,Phylogeographic and Genomic Insights Unveil the Evolutionary History and Post-Glacial Recolonization Routes of the Palmate Newt (<i>Lissotriton helveticus</i>) Into Europe.,"Quaternary glacial cycles have been key drivers of diversification for Holarctic species, promoting divergence, isolation, and extinction processes in numerous taxa. These cycles facilitated evolutionary radiations in some groups but also erased much of the evolutionary history of species with northern origins. Here, we investigate the evolutionary and phylogeographic history of the Palmate Newt (<i>Lissotriton helveticus</i>), a widespread species in post-glacial ecosystems in Western Europe. We generate genome-wide ddRADseq for 205 individuals from 51 populations across the species range and reconstruct its phylogeographic and demographic history, assess population structure, and characterize ecological paleoniches for the species at different climatic periods. Results identify several distinct lineages exhibiting strong genetic differentiation, primarily driven by geographic barriers and isolation in historical refugia with admixture in transition zones. Phylogeographic reconstructions suggest that the main glacial refugium for <i>L. helveticus</i> was most likely located in northern Iberia. Two main dispersal routes were identified: one extending eastward through the Ebro River Basin and a second, following a northeastward pathway across the Pyrenees and into Europe. We specifically pinpoint the origin of Europe's recolonization route to a specific set of localities surrounding Andorra, where <i>L. helveticus</i> probably expanded along tributaries to the Garonne River into southern and western France over warm periods. By integrating genomic, geographic, and paleoclimatic data, this study provides an in-depth understanding of how climate shaped the evolutionary history of this temperate species and reinforces the importance of waterways for amphibian dispersal dynamics.","Burriel-Carranza, Bernat; López-Caro, Jhulyana; Jordà, Adrià; Spilani, Loukia; Talavera, Adrián; Mochales-Riaño, Gabriel; Cabana, Martiño; Montori, Albert; Crochet, Pierre-André; Recuero, Ernesto; García-París, Mario; Martínez-Solano, Íñigo; Fernandez-Guiberteau, Daniel; Carranza, Salvador","Facultat de Biologia Universitat de Barcelona Barcelona Spain.; CEFE, CNRS Univ Montpellier, EPHE, IRD Montpellier France.; (MNCN) Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales MNCN-CSIC Madrid Spain.; Centre de Recerca i Educació Ambiental de Calafell (CREAC-GRENP-Ajuntament de Calafell) Tarragona Spain.; Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona P° Picasso s/n Barcelona Spain.; Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-Universitat Pompeu Fabra) Barcelona Spain.; Grupo de Investigación en Bioloxía Evolutiva (GIBE), Departamento de Bioloxía, Facultade de Ciencias Universidade da Coruña A Coruña Spain.",Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,09,03,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40909018,10.1002/ece3.71994,40909018,0,0,NONE
40837538,Genomics Reveals Distinct Evolutionary Lineages in Asian Elephants.,"This study introduces, for the first time, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from predominantly wild-born Asian elephants currently housed in European zoos, covering the distribution range of Asian elephants. With this WGS data, we aim to validate the current designation of Asian elephant subspecies and address currently discussed ambiguities about their origin, particularly concerning Bornean and Sri Lankan elephants by analyzing population structure, determining divergence times, and exploring ancient and recent bottlenecks. Understanding the evolutionary history of the Asian elephant subspecies is essential for developing targeted conservation strategies and mitigating risks to their survival. Analysis reveals a clear population structure with relatively recent splits, delineating three distinct genetic clusters: Borneo, Sumatra, and Asian Mainland, with Sri Lanka forming an additional group. We estimated the divergence time between Bornean and Sumatran elephants to be around 170,000 years ago. The divergence of the Sri Lankan elephant from the Mainland is estimated to have occurred around 48,000 years ago, with Sri Lankan elephants predominantly clustering with those from Myanmar, possibly due to historical trade networks. The genome of the Bornean elephant exhibited signatures of severe bottlenecks as recently as 8 and 38 generations ago, further supporting hypotheses of their introduction. Our data reflect the current Asian elephant subspecies designation. Additionally, for the first time, the Sumatra elephant is confirmed as a distinct subspecies with genomic data. Furthermore, the study discusses genetic management strategies for ex-situ populations, emphasizing the importance of implementing cluster-specific conservation measures.","Kappelhof, Jeroen; Diepeveen, Emma; Derks, Martijn F L; Madsen, Ole; Rogers, Rebekah; Goossens, Benoit; Sharma, Reeta; Groenen, Martien A M; Windig, Jack J; Bosse, Mirte","Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics University of North Carolina Charlotte North Carolina USA.; A-LIFE, Section Ecology & Evolution Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Amsterdam the Netherlands.; Royal Rotterdam Zoological & Botanical Gardens Rotterdam the Netherlands.; Danau Girang Field Centre C/o Sabah Wildlife Department Kota Kinabalu Sabah Malaysia.; Animal Breeding and Genomics Wageningen University and Research Wageningen the Netherlands.; Organisms and Environment Division, Cardiff School of Biosciences Cardiff University Cardiff UK.; Wildlife Institute of India Dehradun India.",Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,08,18,2025,09,14,R35 GM133376_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40837538,10.1002/ece3.72019,40837538,0,0,NONE
40896089,"Gone With the Wind: Exploring a Vanished Rock Dove, <i>Columba livia</i>, Hybrid Zone in the Sahara Desert.","Rock doves (<i>Columba livia</i>) are the wild ancestor of domestic and feral pigeons and had a wide distribution across Eurasia and the northern part of Africa. West African rock doves have been identified as genetically distinct from all other populations, possibly representing a distinct species. This divergence is hypothesized to have arisen through cycles of allopatry during the dry and wet Sahara periods. Based on the Refugia Theory and observed admixture patterns, it was proposed that a hybrid zone existed in the Sahara during its last green period, playing a critical role in the speciation of West African rock doves. This project aims to test the existence and location of this vanished hybrid zone by analyzing whole-genome sequences from six historical rock doves from previously unsampled populations in the Central Sahara and West Africa, along with published genomic data. By exploring population structure, genetic diversity, and admixture patterns, our results confirm the existence of the hybrid zone, likely located around the mountainous regions of northwest Africa. To explain the observed genetic differentiation of West African rock doves, we propose a four-step scenario involving speciation by reinforcement. Finally, we support a species-level taxonomic arrangement to designate the West African rock dove as <i>C. gymnocycla</i>.","Hernández-Alonso, Germán; van Grouw, Hein; Farahani, Motahare F; Günther, Torsten","SciLifeLab Ancient DNA Unit, Department of Archaeology and Classical Studies Stockholm University Stockholm Sweden.; Human Evolution, Department of Organismal Biology Uppsala University Uppsala Sweden.; Bird Group, Department of Life Sciences Natural History Museum Tring UK.",Ecology and evolution,Ecol Evol,,2025,08,27,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40896089,10.1002/ece3.72061,40896089,0,0,NONE

40879149,Barriers to the implementation of epilepsy genetic testing and counseling guidelines.,"In 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published a practice guideline for genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsy. It is endorsed by the American Epilepsy Society and recommends genetic testing for all patients with unexplained epilepsy (prioritizing exome/genome sequencing [ES/GS] or multi-gene panel [MGP] as first-tier testing) and providing professional pre-/post-test counseling. This study investigates the alignment of neurologists' practice with this guideline and identifies barriers to implementation. Neurologists who treat epilepsy in the United States completed a survey about guideline awareness, current practices, and barriers to genetic testing/counseling. Recruitment occurred through newsletters/listservs of professional organizations and public contact information. A total of, 91 participants accessed the survey, and 84 completed enough for inclusion in data analysis. Approximately half (43.9%, 36/82) of participants offer genetic testing to most/all their patients with unexplained epilepsy, while the other half (46.3%, 38/82) offer genetic testing only to patients with epilepsy for whom they suspect a genetic etiology. Neurologists caring for adult patients were significantly more likely than those caring for pediatric patients to fall into the latter category (χ<sup>2</sup>[1, N = 69] = 22.66, p < 0.001). When ordering genetic testing, 75.5% (n = 40/53) of participants choose MGP most often, while 20.8% (n = 11/53) choose ES/GS and 3.8% (n = 2/53) choose microarray. Barriers to genetic testing and pre-/post-test counseling included insurance coverage, test coordination, limited expertise, and access to a genetic counselor (GC). Barriers were more significant for adult providers. Over half of participants (56.1%, n = 46/82) were aware of the NSGC guideline, but almost all (91.3%, n = 36/82) thought it was not broadly publicized. Increased insurance coverage, access to GCs, and awareness of guidelines are needed to improve access to genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies, particularly for the adult population. In 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline recommending genetic testing and counseling for all patients with unexplained epilepsy, using exome/genome sequencing or a multi-gene panel as the first-tier test. This survey study examined neurologists' current practices compared to the guideline and identified barriers. A total of, 44% of participants offer genetic testing to most/all their patients, while 46% test only when they suspect a genetic cause. Adult neurologists rate most barriers higher than pediatric neurologists. Better insurance coverage and increased access to genetic counselors are key to improving access to epilepsy genetic testing and counseling.","Melly, Sophie; Bergner, Amanda L; Sands, Tristan; Lippa, Natalie; Mulhern, Maureen","Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Program in Genetic Counseling, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Neurology, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Genetics and Development, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.",Epilepsia open,Epilepsia Open,,2025,08,29,2025,08,29,NONE_NONE_National Society of Genetic Counselors_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40879149,10.1002/epi4.70125,,,,
40844318,Clinical and genetic features of multiple primary tumours cohorts with a renal cell carcinoma: Implications for molecular genetic investigations.,"Multiple primary tumours (MPT) is a risk factor for an underlying predisposition to cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) occurs in several hereditary cancer disorder syndromes, and RCC-related MPT comprise individuals with multiple primary renal tumours (MPRT) and those with RCC plus a non-renal tumour (MPT:RCC + X). Excluding rare syndromic causes, knowledge of the genetic architecture of MPRT/MPT:RCC + X is limited. To inform diagnostic approaches to MPRT/MPT:RCC + X, we present the findings of comprehensive genomic analysis in 534 individuals. The presence/absence of variants in cancer susceptibility genes (CSGs) from exome/genome sequencing was then correlated with data on age, sex, tumour types, and RCC histopathology in 93 participants with MPRT and 441 with MPT:RCC + X. 7.5% of participants with MPRT and 6.1% in participants with MPT:RCC + X had germline CSG pathogenic variants, and the diagnostic yields increased to 9.4% and 10.4%, respectively, in cases with RCC <66 years. Excluding participants with environmental carcinogen-linked cancers increased the diagnostic yield in MPT:RCC + X to 12.9%. Pathogenic variants were mostly in CSGs known to predispose to RCC, but in almost half of these cases, typical extrarenal tumours were not present. In conclusion, our findings support amended eligibility criteria for diagnostic testing in MPRT and wider eligibility criteria for testing in MPT:RCC + X, with RCC <66 years.","Zhang, Huairen; Yngvadottir, Bryndis; Andreou, Avgi; Cole, Yasemin; Woodward, Emma R; Whitworth, James; Maher, Eamonn R","Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, and Division of Evolution, Infection and Genomics, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.; Aston Medical School, College of Health and Life Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.",International journal of cancer,Int J Cancer,,2025,08,22,2025,08,22,BRC-1215-20014_NONE_NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre_; NIHR203308_NONE_Manchester Biomedical Research Centre_; NONE_NONE_Gates Cambridge Scholarship_; NONE_NONE_NIH Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program._; NONE_NONE_Cancer Research UK Cambridge Cancer Centre_; NONE_NONE_VHL UK/Ireland_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40844318,10.1002/ijc.70085,40844318,0,0,NONE
40817618,The evolving role of genetic counselors in South Africa: A decade of growth.,"Genetic counseling has evolved from focusing solely on congenital anomaly prevention to incorporating psychological counseling. Traditionally, its goal has been to enhance patient care by providing clinical information and facilitating psychological adjustment. However, with the rise of genomics and complex testing technologies, genetic counselors now engage in education, research, clinical practice, and laboratory roles. A previous study from 2013 described the role of genetic counselors in South Africa. This current study provides an updated perspective on these findings and how these roles have diversified. Registered independent genetic counselors were invited via email to complete an electronic survey adapted from the previous study conducted in 2013. The survey collected data on information pertaining to (1) demographics, (2) genetic counseling experience and employment, and (3) work/clinical practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Of 44 contacted genetic counselors, 29 responded. Most were female (97%), under 40 years old (60%), and had practiced for less than 10 years (59%). Although many genetic counselors took on multiple responsibilitiessuch as clinical, administrative, research, and teaching-the proportion primarily working in clinical roles declined from 75% (12/16) in 2013 to 45% (10/22) in 2023. Notably, genetic counselors involved in teaching and training had significantly fewer years in practice (p = 0.0396; CI 95%), suggesting a loss of expertise in academic centers. A new trend observed since 2013 is laboratory-based responsibilities, with 68% of participants reporting duties in this area. The role of genetic counselors in South Africa has expanded substantially over the past decade, with a shift away from predominantly clinical roles. These findings highlight the need for adaptation of training programs and strategic workforce planning to retain expertise in academic centers and ensure the continued growth of the profession.","Gilfillan, Elzette; Araujo, Monica; Kromberg, Jennifer; Wessels, Tina-Marie; Fourie, Katryn","National Health Laboratory Services and University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.; University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.",Journal of genetic counseling,J Genet Couns,"South Africa, Humans, Genetic Counseling, Female, Male, Adult, Counselors, Professional Role, Middle Aged",2025,08,16,2025,08,26,"R10 000_NONE_University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009467_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40817618,10.1002/jgc4.70097,40817618,1,,[40817618]
40831315,"Shifting ownership, shifting protections: Patient privacy and genetic data ownership in the era of mergers and acquisitions.","Genetic data, more than ever, are a sought-after asset, often transferred or repurposed under broad privacy policies with limited transparency and passive consent. With the increasing frequency of company mergers and acquisitions within the genetics and genomics industry, growing and underacknowledged risks to patient data privacy have emerged. Though informed consent is a foundational element of clinical genetics, our current process rarely addresses what happens to patient data during business transitions. Regulatory frameworks such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) provide limited protections; neither governs how de-identified data are handled, nor do they adequately regulate data transfers during business transitions. This article examines how prominent genetic testing companies address changes in data ownership in their privacy policies and consent forms and traces intercompany relationships to highlight how corporate restructuring can quietly alter who holds and controls patient data. As data sets are increasingly combined within our digital health ecosystem and possibly paired with consumer-generated and publicly accessible information, machine learning now enables re-identification in ways unimaginable to the framers of HIPAA and GINA and at a pace that surpasses our ability to revise or enact protective legislation. As genetic data continues to be a highly valuable asset, genetic counselors must incorporate privacy and ownership as essential parts of informed consent. Although no single counseling model can cover every potential risk that needs to be discussed, overlooking these issues leaves patients unaware of how their data might be used, shared, or sold in the future.","Darnes, Deanna R","Scripps Research Translational Institute, La Jolla, California, USA.",Journal of genetic counseling,J Genet Couns,"Humans, Ownership, Genetic Privacy, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, United States, Confidentiality",2025,08,20,2025,08,20,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40831315,10.1002/jgc4.70101,40831315,0,,
40831303,"Exploring the experience of communication in healthcare settings with parents of children with a rare genetic condition: ""It's the more negative ones that you remember"".","Rare genetic conditions (molecularly diagnosed and undiagnosed) of childhood are typically complex in presentation and natural history. Consequently, the diagnostic odyssey can result in families having multiple interactions with diverse healthcare professionals. The quality of these interactions has been relatively underexplored. Semi-structured interviews explored various parental experiences of communications with genetics and non-genetics healthcare professionals in Australia. Fourteen parents (12 mothers and 2 fathers) of children with rare conditions (12 diagnosed and 2 undiagnosed) agreed to participate. Each interview was recorded, transcribed, and explored using reflexive thematic analysis. Six themes pertaining to the parental experience of communication around genomics were generated. The first is ""the need for family-centered care"" where parents described the importance of involving their child in discussions, even when they are non-verbal. Second, ""the value of à la carte communication"", highlighted that respectful communication, tailored the needs of each family, was highly valued and improved understanding. The third and fourth themes were ""technical language is overwhelming"" and ""negative word choices can be 'soul destroying',"" respectively. These themes captured how insensitive and/or overly complex discussions, can have negative and lasting effects. The fifth theme, ""all results (diagnostic and non-diagnostic) are significant,"" underscored the profound emotional impact of receiving genetic results. The final theme, ""where to from here?"" revealed that many parents felt abandoned after receiving genetic results and were left to ""sink or swim."" Only half of participants had seen a genetic counselor and none could recall being referred to support groups.

40817331,"Classifying dextrans and levans from sugar crop processing microbial isolates with FTIR spectroscopy, machine learning and genomics.","The presence of sucrose-consuming microorganisms and their associated exopolysaccharides (EPS) causes operational challenges for sugar crop (e.g. sugarcane, sugar beet) processing facilities during raw sugar manufacturing. To better prevent factory losses from issues related to microbially-derived EPS, it is necessary to develop easy-to-implement characterization methods for EPS. The two primary types of EPS associated with sugar crop processing are dextrans and levan fructans, which occur to varying degrees during raw sugar production. Chemometric techniques applied to characterization of these EPS can efficiently distinguish between dextran and levan based on their structural differences. In this study, EPS was produced from several bacterial strains isolated from sugarcane and sugar beet factories. These EPS, along with dextran and levan standards, were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). Results from PCA applied to FTIR allow for the ability to distinguish dextran from levan EPS using machine learning techniques (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors). These results are also consistent with dextran- and levan-producing genes identified through whole genome sequencing for the bacterial isolates. The analyses presented in this study demonstrate a low cost, relatively non-labor-intensive analytical classification method for possible identification/characterization of EPS in raw sugar production. Implementation of this type of analytical approach at sugar crop processing facilities and/or laboratories has potential to improve engineering practices for EPS management. Future work applied to mixed samples, polycultures, or sugar crop juices could be explored to further develop chemometric applications. Published 2025.

40851332,Functional Genomics and Probiotic Traits of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MB685 from Fermented Broccoli: Gut Health and Metabolic Insights.,"The current study aimed to isolate and characterize probiotic bacteria with potential health benefits from fermented broccoli. Sixteen bacterial strains were isolated, and two strains (MB685 and MB686) were selected based on their probiotic potential. The isolated strains showed tolerance to pH and temperature variations, and survived well in bile salt concentrations of 0.3% (68%-76%) and 0.5% (61%-71%). MB685 was resistant to gentamicin, ofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, and showed antibacterial activity. Both strains showed significant auto-aggregation (37%-66 % and 53%-43%), as well as cell surface hydrophobicity (56%-62%). MB685 inhibited pancreatic α-amylase by 41.3%, suggesting potential anti-diabetic effects. The 16S rRNA sequencing identified both strains as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Whole-genome sequencing of MB685 revealed a genome size of 3.38 Mb with 3181 coding sequences, including plantaricin production genes (PlnA and PlnN)  and carbohydrate-active enzymes. No virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes were observed, confirming their safety.

Although considerable advances have been made in understanding its migration sources and dispersal patterns with the advent of newer molecular tools, genomic-level insights into these processes, as well as its environmental adaptation mechanisms, remain limited. This study conducted whole-genome resequencing of 289 WBPH individuals from China and Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, to investigate population structure, gene flow and selective signals. Our nuclear and mitochondrial genome analysis revealed minimal genetic differentiation among populations across these regions, suggesting extensive gene flow within and between geographical areas. Consistent demographic patterns across subpopulations highlighted a slight population size reduction during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 20 000-25 000 years ago. The Central China (HBJZ population, Jingzhou, Hubei Province) seems to be a transient hub, with individuals migrating in before dispersing northward across China. Composite likelihood ratio analysis identified 560 regions, encompassing 229 genes, as potential targets of selective sweeps. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment in pathways associated with circadian rhythm, muscle development and function, and cellular responses to cold stress, suggesting adaptive mechanisms that enhance flight endurance and energy efficiency during migration.

40905242,Functional synergy and genomic linkage of glyphosate resistance traits in Canada fleabane.,"Glyphosate resistance in Conyza canadensis (Canada fleabane) has been primarily attributed to non-target-site resistance (NTSR) mechanisms such as vacuolar sequestration, though these have not been formally elucidated. While a target-site mutation at EPSPS2 (P106S) was recently identified, it failed to account for many resistant cases. These findings underscore the need to re-evaluate the genetic basis of glyphosate resistance in this species. Using an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from glyphosate-resistant and susceptible biotypes, we disentangled the individual and combined effects of target-site resistance (TSR) and NTSR. Dose-response phenotyping and genotyping revealed that NTSR conferred broad protection across a wide range of glyphosate doses, while TSR provided a more limited, dose-dependent benefit. When both mechanisms were present, median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) values greatly exceeded additive expectations, indicating a synergistic interaction. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified a major-effect locus associated with NTSR on chromosome 4, with candidate genes linked to membrane transport and subcellular compartmentalization processes. Segregation distortion and recombination frequency estimates suggest moderate genetic linkage between TSR and NTSR loci, facilitating co-inheritance of resistance alleles. This study provides the first explicit quantitative analysis of gene × gene interactions underlying herbicide resistance in C. canadensis. By disentangling TSR and NTSR, we show that single copies of the TSR and NTSR alleles confer approximately nine-fold and seven-fold glyphosate resistance, respectively. When combined, these mechanisms exhibit synergism, resulting in resistance levels that exceed additive LD<sub>50</sub> expectations by more than two-fold. Both TSR and NTSR loci have been mapped to chromosome 4, and moderate genomic linkage (~27% recombination) between them will likely contribute to the persistence and spread of high-level resistance, even under low selection pressure. © 2025 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada.

40852839,Chromosome-level haplotype-resolved genome assembly provides insights into the highly heterozygous genome of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.).,"Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) is an important forage grass, providing a major source of feed for ruminants in temperate regions. Due to its highly heterozygous and repeat-rich genome, high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies are scarce for Italian ryegrass. Here, we sequenced the genome of a genotype from the Italian ryegrass cultivar 'Rabiosa' (hereafter referred to as Rabiosa), and we obtained Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads (∼60-fold coverage), Illumina short reads (∼85-fold coverage), and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture data (∼60-fold coverage). With Rabiosa as one of the parents, we constructed an F<sub>1</sub> population consisting of 304 individuals, which were genotyped by reduced representation sequencing for linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Using whole-genome sequencing data of Rabiosa and the genetic linkage map, we first generated a chromosome-level unphased haploid assembly (scaffold N50 of 338.75 Mb, total Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs [BUSCO] score of 94.60%). Then, based on the unphased assembly and a reference-based phasing approach, we generated a chromosome-level haplotype-resolved assembly containing both haplotypes (scaffold N50 of ∼250 Mb and total BUSCO score of ∼90% for each haplome). Between the two haplotypes of Rabiosa, we observed a highly collinear gene order at the chromosome level and a high sequence variation at the local level. With a graph-based reference built from the unphased and the haplotype-resolved assemblies of Rabiosa, we conducted a QTL analysis, and two QTL significantly associated with stem rust resistance were detected. The genome assemblies of Rabiosa will serve as invaluable genomic resources to facilitate genomic applications in forage grass research and breeding.","Chen, Yutang; Kiesbauer, Jenny; Copetti, Dario; Frei, Daniel; Frey, Jürg E; Grieder, Christoph; Kölliker, Roland; Studer, Bruno","Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; Arizona Genomics Institute, School of Plant Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Methods Development and Analytics, Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland.; Fodder Plant Breeding, Division of Plant Breeding, Agroscope, Zurich, Switzerland.; Molecular Plant Breeding, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",The plant genome,Plant Genome,"Lolium, Genome, Plant, Haplotypes, Quantitative Trait Loci, Chromosomes, Plant, Heterozygote, Chromosome Mapping",2025,06,16,2025,08,29,847585_NONE_H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40852839,10.1002/tpg2.70079,40852839,0,0,NONE
40804709,"From Junk DNA to Genomic Treasure: Impacts of Transposable Element DNA, RNA, and Protein in Mammalian Development and Disease.","Transposable elements (TEs) have hijacked cellular machineries to replicate and spread throughout host genomes. TEs now make up a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes and play notable roles in genomic evolution, driving both speciation and providing raw material for genetic innovation. Barbara McClintock's pioneering work on these ""jumping genes"" laid the foundation for modern TE research; however, her paradigm-shifting theories in which TEs act as ""controlling elements"" were initially rejected due to the long-held belief that TEs were ""junk"" or parasitic DNA elements. Historically, the highly repetitive nature of TEs made it challenging to both identify and investigate functions. However, recent advances in genomics have greatly accelerated our understanding of TEs. Despite their potential to cause insertional mutagenesis and disease, many transposable elements have been co-opted by host genomes to contribute to gene regulation and development. In contrast to protein-coding genes that typically begin their journey as DNA, are transcribed into RNA, and reach their ultimate functional form as proteins, TEs can function as cis-regulatory DNA, functional RNA, and in rare cases, domesticated proteins and fusion events between TE and host genes. Driven by rapidly advancing technologies, the roles of TEs in both development and disease are being uncovered faster than ever, making current and future work an exciting continuation of Barbara McClintock's groundbreaking legacy.","Li, Ten D; Toohill, Katelyn; Modzelewski, Andrew J","Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.",Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes that keep together coadapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of many complex phenotypes in diverse organisms.

40828279,Evolutionary Genomics of Gene Families: A Case Study of Insect Gustatory Receptors.,"Gene families, which are groups of genes that share common ancestry and are often functionally related, constitute a substantial proportion of the protein-coding sequences within eukaryotic genomes. In insects, genes involved in chemoperception belong to gene families characterized by numerous copies that arise from episodic bursts of gene duplication. This biological process is crucial for insect survival, as it enables the perception of environmental chemical cues. In this chapter, we analyze the gustatory receptors in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta and present a protocol for bioinformatic analyses. First, we employ BITACORA to identify and annotate gene family members in the genome assembly, providing tools for the annotation and subsequent validation.

40884650,Artificial Intelligence and Chromothripsis.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a new alternative in the healthcare domain, particularly in genomics, promising to revolutionize medicine with its various applications. In this chapter, we explore the potential of AI in genetics and research, with a particular focus on its role in the detection and characterization of chromothripsis. Chromothripsis, marked by complex genomic rearrangements, presents significant challenges in detection and interpretation. Traditional methods such as karyotyping, FISH, array-CGH, and NGS have limitations in accurately identifying chromothripsis events. However, recent advances in AI, including deep learning and machine learning, offer promising opportunities to overcome these challenges. By utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms, researchers can analyze complex genomic datasets, identify recurrent patterns, and predict functional consequences associated with chromothripsis with unprecedented accuracy. Additionally, AI facilitates the integration of multi-omics data, enabling a holistic understanding of chromothripsis in various pathological contexts. Through case studies and recent advancements, we highlight the potential of AI in advancing our understanding of chromothripsis and its clinical applications.","Callegarin, Davide; Maaziz, Nada; Mosca, Anne-Laure; Marle, Nathalie; Opale, Mélodie; Nicolle, Christophe; Callier, Patrick","Laboratoire CIAD (Connaissances et Intelligence Artificielle Distribuées), UMR 7533, Univ.

40884671,The Evolutionary Potential of Chromoanagenesis.,"Many genomics specialists recognize that the massive genome rearrangements grouped under the term ""chromoanagenesis"" are a path to rapid evolutionary change by restructuring chromosomes, creating chimeric sequence combinations, and altering regulatory interactions leading to novel phenotypes. Less attention has been paid to the role of ubiquitous eukaryotic double-strand DNA break repair functions known as ""alternative end-joining"" (AltEJ) in generating additional DNA sequence innovation. A close look at some examples of chromoanagenesis rearrangements in the human germline and tumor cells illustrates how diverse these novel sequences can be. AltEJ creates sequence duplications and DNA insertions into junctions between chromosome breakpoints; these insertions range in size from a few base pairs up to many kilobases in length. The AltEJ insertions can come from nearby or distal sequences on one of the rearranged chromosomes, from another chromosome, or from de novo replication without template carried out by the versatile DNA polymerase theta, an enzyme known for its activity as an untemplated DNA terminal transferase. In a significant number of cases, the AltEJ insertions contain novel combinations of several segments copied from more than one region of the genome by a phenomenon known as ""template switching."" By virtue of the combinatorial and creative actions of AltEJ in chromosome restructuring, massive genome change by chromoanagenesis contributes an apparently limitless range of DNA sequence innovation to eukaryotic evolutionary novelty.","Shapiro, James A","Emeritus, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. jsha@uchicago.edu.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Methods Mol Biol,"Humans, Evolution, Molecular, DNA End-Joining Repair, DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded",2025,08,21,2025,08,30,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40884671,10.1007/978-1-0716-4750-9_37,,,,
40884639,Performing SABER-FISH on Chromosome Spreads in Fixed Tissue Culture Cells and in Tissues.,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) visualizes targeted nucleic acid sequences in fixed samples, imparting information about target location and abundance. By itself, targets are limited to large regions or those with high copy number due to low fluorescent signal, motivating a need for signal amplification methods. In this chapter, we detail signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER), a recent advancement in FISH technology that incorporates long, repetitive concatemers into FISH probes to recruit complementary fluorescent probes. The additional binding sites on the concatemers result in a 5- to 450-fold boost in RNA and DNA FISH signals, unlocking the potential to target smaller regions. This method offers a rapid, versatile, and cost-effective approach for multiplexed nucleic acid imaging. By incorporating SABER into FISH protocols, researchers can achieve high sampling efficiency and overcome the limitations of traditional FISH techniques. This chapter aims to describe the SABER FISH technology and provide detailed steps for applying RNA and DNA SABER FISH to a variety of samples, including on metaphase spreads, cells, and tissues (FFPE and fixed cryosections) across mouse and human specimens.","Attar, Sahar; Krebs, Mary; Nichols, Eva K; Akilesh, Shreeram; Beliveau, Brian J","Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. beliveau@uw.edu96.; Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Kidney Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.; Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. beliveau@uw.edu96.; Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. beliveau@uw.edu96.; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Methods Mol Biol,"In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Animals, Humans, Mice, Tissue Fixation, Chromosomes",2025,08,21,2025,08,30,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40884639,10.1007/978-1-0716-4750-9_5,,,,
40864264,Climate change and plant genomic plasticity.,"Genome adaptation, driven by mutations, transposable elements, and structural variations, relies on plasticity and instability. This allows populations to evolve, enhance fitness, and adapt to challenges like climate change. Genomes adapt via mutations, transposable elements, DNA structural changes, and epigenetics. Genome plasticity enhances fitness by providing the genetic variation necessary for organisms to adapt their traits and survive, which is especially critical during rapid climate shifts. This plasticity often stems from genome instability, which facilitates significant genomic alterations like duplications or deletions. While potentially harmful initially, these changes increase genetic diversity, aiding adaptation. Major genome reorganizations arise from polyploidization and horizontal gene transfer, both linked to instability. Plasticity and restructuring can modify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), contributing to adaptation. Tools like landscape genomics identify climate-selected regions, resurrection ecology reveals past adaptive responses, and pangenome analysis examines a species' complete gene set. Signatures of past selection include reduced diversity and allele frequency shifts. Gene expression plasticity allows environmental adaptation without genetic change through mechanisms like alternative splicing, tailoring protein function. Co-opted transposable elements also generate genetic and regulatory diversity, contributing to genome evolution. This review consolidates these findings, repositioning genome instability not as a mere source of random error but as a fundamental evolutionary engine that provides the rapid adaptive potential required for plant survival in the face of accelerating climate change.","Pozzi, Carlo M; Gaiti, Angelo; Spada, Alberto","Dipartimento Di Scienze Per Gli Alimenti, La Nutrizione E L'Ambiente, Università Di Milano, Via Celoria 2, 20133, Milan, Italy.; Dipartimento Di Scienze Agrarie Ed Ambientali, Università Di Milano, Via Celoria 2, 20133, Milan, Italy.; Dipartimento Di Scienze Agrarie Ed Ambientali, Università Di Milano, Via Celoria 2, 20133, Milan, Italy. carlo.pozzi@unimi.it.",TAG.

40920205,Genomic and metabolomic insights into the biosynthesis of carotenoids and lipids in oleaginous red yeast Cystofilobasidium infirmominiatum HZR20 isolated from Mangrove plants in Southern China.,"Cystofilobasidium infirmominiatum, biotechnologically significant yeast, is increasingly garnering attention due to its superior ability to produce valuable carotenoids and lipids. Nonetheless, until now, the reference genome that governs the biosynthesis of carotenoids and lipids in C. infirmominiatum remains unreported. Here, the first genome assembly of C. infirmominiatum was performed through integrating Oxford Nanopore and Illumina NovaSeq techniques. The assembled genome is 27.61 Mb in size, comprising 35 scaffolds, with a N50 length of 1,144,974 bp and a GC content of 68.21%. It was predicted to encompass 10,719 protein-coding genes, with functional annotation conducted on 8,045 utilizing the NR database. Moreover, C. infirmominiatum was capable of synthesizing at least 3 carotenoids, 839 Lipids, 1,876 volatile organic compounds, and 540 other metabolites, as revealed by LC/GC-MS-based metabolomic profiling. Integrative multi-omics analysis identified key carotenogenic and lipogenic genes, as well as their related metabolic intermediates. The findings presented herein significantly improve our comprehension of the biosynthetic mechanisms of carotenoids and lipids in C. infirmominiatum. It furnishes a valuable genomic and metabolomic framework that facilitates fundamental molecular biology and comparative genomics studies, thereby broadening our insights into the genetic features and evolutionary dynamics of this species.","Zhao, Die; Zeng, Nan; Wang, Dandan; Xie, Zhenyan; Xie, Mimi; Zhu, Jiaqi; Li, Bingxue; Yu, Guohui; Li, Chunji","College of Land and Environment, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, People's Republic of China.; College of Agriculture and Biology, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China. lichunji0804@126.com.; Innovative Institute for Plant Health, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China.; Guangdong University Key Laboratory for Sustainable Control of Fruit and Vegetable Diseases and Pests, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China.; Key Laboratory of Green Prevention and Control on Fruits and Vegetables in South China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China. lichunji0804@126.com.; Guangdong University Key Laboratory for Sustainable Control of Fruit and Vegetable Diseases and Pests, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China. lichunji0804@126.com.; Key Laboratory of Green Prevention and Control on Fruits and Vegetables in South China, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China.; Innovative Institute for Plant Health, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China. lichunji0804@126.com.; College of Agriculture and Biology, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, 510225, People's Republic of China.",Archives of microbiology,Arch Microbiol,"Carotenoids, Basidiomycota, Genome, Fungal, China, Lipids, Metabolomics, Genomics, Lipid Metabolism, Phylogeny",2025,09,08,2025,09,08,32101930_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40920205,10.1007/s00203-025-04456-3,40920205,0,0,NONE
40892062,Revolutionizing toxicological risk assessment: integrative advances in new approach methodologies (NAMs) and precision toxicology.,"Traditional toxicological paradigms, reliant on animal testing and simplistic in vitro models, face significant limitations, including prolonged timelines, high costs, and poor translational predictability due to interspecies differences. This review highlights the transformative potential of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) in overcoming these challenges. Key advancements include Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) platforms that emulate human organ physiology and multi-organ crosstalk, significantly improving predictive accuracy. Integration of multi-omics technologies (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) provides unprecedented mechanistic insights into toxicity pathways. Computational toxicology, leveraging machine learning and QSAR modeling, enables high-throughput hazard prioritization and risk prediction. While NAMs offer human-relevant, efficient alternatives for chemical safety evaluation, critical bottlenecks remain. These involve insufficient physiological complexity in current in vitro models, interpretability limitations of AI-driven approaches, challenges in quantifying mixture toxicity and low-dose effects, and a lag in regulatory adoption. Emerging strategies like probabilistic risk assessment, AI-driven exposomics, and tiered testing paradigms hold promise for addressing chemical mixture risks and personalized exposures. Future progress requires interdisciplinary collaboration to refine microphysiological systems, harmonize regulatory frameworks with scientific innovation, and establish open-access data repositories, paving the way for precision toxicology and sustainable chemical risk management.","Sheng, Qiu-Shuang; Liu, Bin; Wang, Xiao; Hua, Lei; Zhao, Shou-Cheng; Sun, Xiao-Zhong; Li, Mu-Yang; Zhang, Xiang-Yu; Wang, Jia-Xu; Hu, Pei-Li","National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing, 100050, China.; Jilin Province Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Institute, Changchun, 130103, China.; Jilin Province Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Institute, Changchun, 130103, China. shengqiushuang@jlzjy.org.",Archives of toxicology,Arch Toxicol,,2025,09,02,2025,09,02,20250202067NC_NONE_the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40892062,10.1007/s00204-025-04169-y,,,,
40794131,"Tumor location, genomic alterations, and radiomic features as predictors of survival in glioblastoma: a Multi-Modal analysis.","This study aims to identify the impact of tumor location on the survival of glioblastoma (GBM) patients and the associated genetic alterations, using MRI scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). It also seeks to uncover non-invasive radiomic markers related to poor survival outcome for improved prognosis and treatment planning. We analysed pre-operative MRI scans and genomic data from 123 GBM patients (TCIA and TCGA). Tumor locations were determined using our in-house tool, ""tumorVQ"", followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on tumor position. Genomic analysis included somatic mutations, copy number variations, fusion genes, and differential gene expression to identify factors linked to poor survival. We extracted radiomic features from T1ce MRI scans using pyRadiomics to analyse their relationship with survival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed worse survival for tumors in the parietal lobe compared to other lobes, especially frontal lobe tumors. Genomic analysis revealed high prevalence of PTEN mutations, and exclusive fusion genes FGFR3-TACC3 and EGFR-SEPT14 in parietal lobe tumors. Differential gene expression showed upregulation of PITX2, HOXB13, and DTHD1, linked to tumor progression, while ALOX15 downregulation increased relapse risk. Copy number alterations, like LINC00290 deletions, were associated with aggressive parietal lobe tumors. Radiomic features, lower GLDM DependanceEntropy (LLL) and higher FirstOrder Mean (HLL), were strongly linked to increase risk. This study highlights poor survival outcomes in GBM patients with parietal lobe tumors. Key genetic alterations, such as PTEN mutations and fusion genes, drive tumor progression and chemoresistance in parietal lobe tumors. The association between radiomic features and survival indicates their potential as non-invasive prognostic biomarkers, which could aid in personalized treatment and improved patient management.","Kundal, Kavita; Rao, K Venkateswara; Dhanda, Sandeep Kumar; Kumar, Neeraj; Kumar, Rahul","Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, India. rahulk@bt.iith.ac.in.; Department of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, India.; Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Kandi, Sangareddy, India.; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.; Basavatarakam Indo American Cancer Hospital & Research Institute, Hyderabad, India.",Neuroradiology,Neuroradiology,,2025,08,12,2025,08,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40794131,10.1007/s00234-025-03742-7,40794131,0,,
40815312,Mapping copy number variable regions correlated with reproduction and production traits in Karan Fries cattle mammalian genomics.,"Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are the structural variations influencing more nucleotides when compared to other types of variations, having a greater impact on the regulation of gene expression, dosage of a gene, altering the coding sequences, all of which might lead to phenotypic variations. Research in the areas of the characterizing CNVs, their discovery and genesis, and their functional effects is in infancy particularly in Indian cattle breeds. We hypothesized that due to the intensive selection for production traits carried out for a premium milch crossbred cattle Karan-fries, they might be characterized by unique CNVs. In order to discover and characterize the genome-wide CNVs and CNV Regions (CNVRs) using HD SNP genotypic array, the current study was carried out on 44 Karan-Fries Cattle. To take use of the complementing advantages of the various methodologies, three distinct approaches (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, and CNVPartition) to identify CNVs were chosen. The techniques mentioned above revealed 2989, 4088, 2316 CNVs, and 980, 1526 917 CNVRegions respectively. The study failed to find a consistent pattern for the number and size of CNV (either overestimation or underestimate by different algorithms). PennCNV algorithm results could be considered to be more accurate than others as there was higher overlapping of PennCNV results by other algorithms. BTA5, BTA12, and BTA17 were significantly enriched for CNVs. QTLs for milk beta-lactoglobulin percentage and interval from estrus to calving were considerably enriched. Using combination of various approaches, the entire CNVR map for Karan-Fries Cattle was developed. This map could be used as a guide for other native breeds and crossbreds.","Togla, Oshin; Bhardwaj, Shivam; Kadyan, Sagar; Wani, Yaser Mushtaq; Mukherjee, Sabyasachi; Mukherjee, Anupama","AGB, NDRI, Karnal, India.; Quantitative Genetics and Genomics Lab, AGB, NDRI, Karnal, India.; Quantitative Genetics & Genomics Lab, Animal Genetics and Breeding Division, National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, 124001, India. writetoanupama@gmail.com.; Livestock Production Management, LUVAS, Haryana, India.; AGB, NDRI, Karnal, India. writetoanupama@gmail.com.",Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,Mamm Genome,,2025,08,15,2025,08,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40815312,10.1007/s00335-025-10152-w,40815312,0,,

40844737,Whole genome sequencing analysis in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patients reveals mutations in neurological diseases-causing genes.,"Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is a rare, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that predominantly affects upper motor neurons. Despite being considered mostly sporadic, familial cases and rare genetic variants in genes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia and other neurological disorders have been reported in some PLS cases. Due to its rare prevalence among general population, large genetic studies of PLS are lacking. Fifty patients diagnosed with PLS based on consensus criteria were enrolled between 2013 and 2022 for comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis using whole genome sequencing. We analyzed rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs), deemed pathogenic, likely pathogenic or of uncertain significance (VUS) based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria, and repeat expansions (REs) exceeding the pathogenic threshold, in 290 genes involved in neurological disorders. We identified mutations in 7 patients (13.7%), specifically SNVs in CAPN1 (Spastic paraplegia 76), TBK1 (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, ALS4/FTD), LITAF (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1C), POLG (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), APP (Alzheimer's disease) and OPTN (ALS12 ± FTD), and one RE in ATXN8OS (spinocerebellar ataxia 8). Additionally, two VUS were found in ANTXR2, a candidate gene for PLS recently identified via truncating variant collapsing analysis, but none of them was loss-of-function (one synonymous and one in-frame insertion). Our study demonstrates a notable genetic intersection between PLS and various neurological disorders, including motor neuron diseases, neuropathies, mitochondrial disorders, ataxias, and dementias.

The genus Triumfetta Plum. ex L. (Grewioideae, Malvaceae) is a pantropical group comprising approximately 177 species. Despite its diversity, its chloroplast (cp) genomics remain unstudied. To investigate evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic relationships within Triumfetta, complete cp genomes of eight species were de novo assembled and compared with two publicly available genomes. These cp genomes were 160,075 to 160,604 base pairs (bp) long and consisted of a large single-copy region (89,006-89,386 bp), a small single-copy region (20,142-20,266 bp), and a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb, 25,440-25,498 bp), encoding 112 unique genes (78 protein-coding, 30 transfer RNA, and 4 ribosomal RNA). Comparative analyses showed high similarity in GC content, IR contraction/expansion, codon usage, substitution patterns, and repeat structures. An inversion was identified in the LSC region of Triumfetta tomentosa, reversing six genes: trnC, petN, psbM, trnD, trnY, and trnE, without gene loss. Six genes (psbK, rpl20, rpl23, rps16, rps7, and ycf2) showed signatures of positive selection, suggesting potential roles in adaptation. Ten polymorphic loci were identified across intergenic and coding regions, including trnR-atpA, rpl33-rps18, ccsA-ndhD, clpP, rpl22, and ycf1, representing useful markers for DNA barcoding and population genetics.

40866734,Comparative genomics of plastid genome within Curculigo orchioides subclade (Hypoxidaceae) reveals evolutionary relationships and document the shortest ndhA intron in seed plants.,"This study presents the first comprehensive plastome analysis of Curculigo, filling a genomic gap in Hypoxidaceae, reveals its evolutionary relationships, and identifies the shortest known ndhA intron among seed plants. Comparative genomics is an effective tool for exploring plastome evolution and gene content variation across species. In the genus Curculigo (Hypoxidaceae), plastome research has been restricted to C. orchioides and C. capitulata. To enhance our understanding of evolutionary relationships within this genus, we sequenced and assembled complete plastomes of the five Indian species: C. brevifolia, C. janarthanamii, C. konkanensis, C. orchioides, and C. sabui, all belonging to the C. orchioides subclade. The plastomes (158,114-158,205 bp) contained 113 unique genes, including 79 protein coding, with codon usage ranging from 23,139 to 24,434. We identified 49 long repeats (30-66 bp), primarily in intergenic spacers and eight genes and 42-47 SSRs per genome. LSC/IR/SSC junction analyses revealed conserved positioning across species. Six hotspot regions were detected, with trnL-trnF and rpl32-trnL-UAG previously reported in Asparagales. A unique 508-nt deletion in the ndhA intron of C. orchioides 2 resulted in the shortest known intron among seed plants. Complete ribosomal DNA sequences (7015-8702 bp) were also assembled and utilized for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies based on whole plastomes, 79 coding sequences, and rDNA data resolved the relationships among six Curculigo taxa. Further multigene analysis with additional taxa supported earlier studies while offering greater resolution within the C. orchioides group. Our results reveal a largely conserved plastome architecture punctuated by lineage-specific indels that constitute useful synapomorphies within Hypoxidaceae. The new genomic resources and clarified phylogeny provide a robust framework to support future research in species delimitation, adaptive evolution, and conservation genetics of this medicinally valuable genus.","Tamboli, Asif S; Choi, In-Su; Youn, Jin-Suk; Mane, Rohit N; Gholave, Avinash R; Chandore, Arun N; Pak, Jae Hong; Kiedrzyński, Marcin","Department of Botany, Rayat Shikshan Sanstha's, Loknete Ramsheth Thakur Arts, Science and Commerce College, Mokhada, Palghar District, Maharashtra, 401 604, India.; Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Hannam University, Daejeon, 34054, Republic of Korea. 86ischoi@hnu.kr.; Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Hannam University, Daejeon, 34054, Republic of Korea. asift456@gmail.com.; Department of Botany, Rayat Shikshan Sanstha's, Balwant College, Vita, Sangli, Maharashtra, 415 311, India.; Department of Biogeography, Paleoecology and Nature Conservation, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, 90-237, Lodz, Poland.; Research Institute for Dok-do and Ulleung-do Island, Kyungpook National University, 80 Daehak-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.; Department of Botany, K.V.N.

40879805,Secondary findings in pediatric genomic testing: clinical insights from Turkey.,"The clinical expansion of whole exome and genome sequencing has raised critical questions regarding the management of secondary findings (SFs), particularly in pediatric populations. We aimed to determine the frequency, characteristics, and familial implications of SFs in a cohort of 980 Turkish pediatric patients, while addressing the ethical and psychological challenges of reporting adult-onset risks. We retrospectively analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 980 pediatric patients. SFs were reviewed based on the 81 genes in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) SFs v3.2 list. Only variants classified as Pathogenic (P) or Likely Pathogenic (LP) according to ACMG/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines were reported. The distribution of these variants across clinical disease categories represented by the ACMG SFs gene list (e.g., cancer predisposition, cardiovascular, metabolic) was evaluated. We identified actionable variants in 1.9% of patients. The most commonly affected genes were associated with cancer predisposition syndromes and cardiovascular conditions. This finding is consistent with the eMERGE study, which reported a 3.02% overall frequency of SFs (2.54% within the 59 ACMG-recommended genes), with cancer and cardiac genes being the most commonly reported categories. Differences in typical age of disease onset were noted, potentially impacting clinical management in pediatric settings. Despite most variants being inherited, a positive family history was documented in only one case, underscoring the limitations of family history alone in identifying at-risk individuals. No single gene was overrepresented, and the distribution of identified variants was consistent with what has been observed in other populations. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of ACMG v3.2 SFs in a Turkish pediatric population. While consistent with global literature, our findings contribute novel, age and population-specific data. Most identified variants were inherited, underscoring opportunities for early diagnosis and management not only in children but also in asymptomatic parents through cascade screening. These results highlight that the responsible and evidence-based return of SFs in pediatric care requires a balanced approach one that weighs clinical benefit against ethical responsibility. Our findings may inform the integration of genomic screening and policy development in pediatric care, particularly in resource-limited settings. • Secondary findings (SFs) from clinical genomic sequencing can uncover medically actionable risks unrelated to the primary indication. In pediatric patients, however, the disclosure of SFs-particularly those related to adult-onset conditions-raises ethical concerns regarding autonomy and parental decision-making. While the ACMG recommends returning SFs regardless of age, their guidelines highlight the critical role of pre- and post-test counseling and the option for families to accept or decline such results. • Despite these recommendations, pediatric-specific evidence remains scarce, especially in regions with emerging or resource-limited healthcare systems such as Turkey. Expanding context-specific data is essential for guiding ethically sound and equitable implementation of genomic medicine in pediatric populations. • This study represents the first pediatric-only analysis of secondary findings in a Turkish cohort using the ACMG v3.2 gene list. Unlike previous Turkish studies with mixed or undefined age groups, it focuses exclusively on children, thereby providing age-specific insights into the prevalence and characteristics of actionable variants. • While most findings involved cancer predisposition and cardiovascular genes, as expected given the ACMG SF list structure, the study contributes unique pediatric data from a region with limited prior representation. Such region-specific pediatric datasets are essential to guide the equitable and context-sensitive implementation of genomic medicine.","Kendir-Demirkol, Yasemin; Yeter, Burcu","Department of Pediatric Genetics, University of Health Sciences, Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey.; Department of Pediatric Genetics, University of Health Sciences, Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey. dryasminkendir@yahoo.com.",European journal of pediatrics,Eur J Pediatr,"Humans, Turkey, Child, Retrospective Studies, Male, Genetic Testing, Female, Child, Preschool, Adolescent, Infant, Exome Sequencing, Incidental Findings, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genomics, Infant, Newborn",2025,08,29,2025,08,29,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40879805,10.1007/s00431-025-06415-y,,,,
40810913,Comparative pan-genome analysis of Huperzia and Phlegmariurus and transcriptomics reveals thermal adaptation in Huperzia.,"Huperzia and Phlegmariurus are ancient genera within the Lycopodiaceae family with significant medicinal value and ecological adaptability, yet the evolutionary dynamics and genetic diversity of their chloroplast genomes remain poorly characterized. Specifically, critical aspects such as intergeneric differences, phylogenetic relationships, and adaptive evolution within their chloroplast genomes remain insufficiently explored. This study analyzed the chloroplast genomes of 66 species from these two genera through comparative genomics to elucidate their structural dynamics and adaptive mechanisms. Results revealed that Huperzia chloroplast genomes (153-155 kb, GC content 36.25-36.39%) are significantly larger than those of Phlegmariurus (148-151 kb, GC content 33.78-34.26%), with pronounced differences in IR boundary dynamics, repetitive sequence distribution, nucleotide diversity, and codon usage bias. Phylogenetic and population structure analyses confirmed the monophyly of both genera and demonstrated significantly higher genetic diversity in Phlegmariurus, likely linked to adaptive radiation driven by humid tropical environments. Transcriptomic data revealed a temporally coordinated chloroplast response to heat stress in Huperzia serrata. Photosynthetic core genes (such as psaB and rrna16) were downregulated, leading to sustained functional impairment. In contrast, early stress-response genes (such as rbcL and trnI-GAU) peaked at 4 h to enhance carbon fixation and transport. Mid-phase repair genes (such as ndhG and rps8) exhibited inverted U-shaped expression patterns to activate electron transport and protein synthesis, whereas late-stage overexpression of atpI restored energy homeostasis. This coordinated regulatory mechanism illustrates a survival strategy of ""photosynthetic inhibition-stress compensation-energy reorganization"" for thermal adaptation. Future studies should integrate nuclear genome and epigenetic modification data to further unravel the synergistic nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions underlying environmental adaptation.","Li, Muzi; Wu, Yazhu; Li, Haibo; Zhang, Zhongnian; Qin, Rui; Wen, Jiahao; Xu, Yeqin; Bao, Chengcheng; Wang, Dekai","Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism Regulation in Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang, China.; Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism Regulation in Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang, China. wangdk@zstu.edu.cn.; Yuyao City Seed and Seedling Management Station, Ningbo, 315499, Zhejiang, China.",Functional & integrative genomics,Funct Integr Genomics,"Transcriptome, Genome, Chloroplast, Phylogeny, Huperzia, Photosynthesis, Thermotolerance, Adaptation, Physiological",2025,08,14,2025,08,26,2021C02043_NONE_Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province_; NBSXZX2025-023_NONE_Germplasm Resource Protection Project of Yuyao Seedling Management Station_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40810913,10.1007/s10142-025-01680-4,40810913,0,,

Although Cayratia japonica has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries, the mechanisms underlying flavonoid biosynthesis in this plant remain largely unexplored. In this study, combining transcriptomics and bioinformatics, we constructed a transcriptome database for three tissues of Cayratia japonica. We identified 38 unigenes related to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the expression levels of three key enzyme-encoding genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase gene (DN990) and two chalcone isomerase genes (DN1381, DN2421)) were significantly and positively correlated with the total flavonoid content. Subsequently, the tertiary structures of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase and chalcone isomerases were constructed, and structure-based docking analysis was carried o ut. The expression levels of 16 key enzyme genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were verified using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Four MYB transcription factors involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were also identified. In addition, five potentially important therapeutic targets for Ulcerative colitis were predicted through network pharmacological analysis. This study provides references for understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of key enzyme-encoding genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, as well as a scientific basis for the further development of the medicinal potential of Cayratia japonica.","Sun, Mengge; Xie, Wanying; Xu, Leiming; Wang, Zhiwei; Fan, Jinshibo; Xie, Ziyang; Wu, Jiawen; Tao, Yijia","Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230038, China. wujiawen@ahtcm.edu.cn.; Anhui Institute for Food and Drug Control, Hefei, 230051, China.; Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230038, China. wujiawen@ahtcm.edu.cn.; Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230038, China.; Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Improvement, Hefei, 230012, China. wujiawen@ahtcm.edu.cn.; Anhui University of Chinese Medicine and Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230038, China. taoyijia@ahtcm.edu.cn.; Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230038, China.",Functional & integrative genomics,Funct Integr Genomics,"Flavonoids, Transcriptome, Colitis, Ulcerative, Molecular Docking Simulation, Coenzyme A Ligases, Plant Proteins, Intramolecular Lyases, Humans, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant",2025,08,26,2025,08,27,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40856743,10.1007/s10142-025-01695-x,40856743,0,0,NONE

The genus Bidens (Asteraceae), comprising approximately 280 species, represents a morphologically diverse lineage with significant medicinal and economic value. Here, we assembled the complete plastid genome (plastome) of Bidens alba and conducted comprehensive comparative analyses across 31 Bidens species, integrating structural characterization, simple sequence repeat (SSR) distribution, codon usage bias assessment, and selection pressure analysis through Ka/Ks ratios and phylogenomic reconstruction. All plastomes exhibited the canonical angiosperm quadripartite structure (150,490 - 151,856 bp) with consistent AT bias (average GC content: 37.48%) and mononucleotide SSR predominance (37.43%). Twenty-nine high-frequency codons displayed strong AT preference, with multiple analytical approaches confirming natural selection as the primary driver of codon usage bias. The non-synonymous (Ka) /synonymous (Ks) substitution ratios revealed that most protein-coding genes showed evidence of purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 0.5), though the ycf2 and accD genes displayed elevated ratios suggesting adaptive evolution. Phylogenomic reconstruction supported Bidens monophyly with high bootstrap values and resolved species relationships with high confidence. Comparative structural analysis revealed exceptional genomic conservation across the genus, suggesting that while sequence evolution has occurred, the fundamental genomic architecture remains stable. These findings provide crucial insights into significant structural conservation across Bidens plastomes while demonstrating active sequence-level evolution, providing crucial insights into plastome evolutionary mechanisms within rapidly diversifying lineages and establish a robust genomic framework for understanding ecological adaptation and phylogenetic relationships in this ecologically important lineage.","Xue, Ying; Qin, Shaowei; Xianyu, Zhangchen; Wang, Haodi; Yu, Jialei; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Liang, Xingxing; Li, Dong; Gai, Yunpeng","School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China.; School of Grassland Science, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, 100083, China. gaiyunpeng@bjfu.edu.cn.",Functional & integrative genomics,Funct Integr Genomics,"Codon Usage, Evolution, Molecular, Phylogeny, Genome, Plastid, Selection, Genetic, Bidens, Base Composition, Codon, Microsatellite Repeats",2025,08,27,2025,08,27,BLX202162_NONE_The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40864307,10.1007/s10142-025-01699-7,40864307,0,0,NONE

Here we are reporting complete chloroplast genome of Stellaria media (L.) Vill. collected from Dokdo Island, South Korea. The genome, assembled at 6340 × coverage, is 147,329 bp with a typical quadripartite structure, covering two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 25,600 bp and one single copy of large (79,366 bp) and small region (16,763 bp) each. Genome annotation identified 129 genes, including 84 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA and 37 tRNA genes. In the IR region, ycf3 and clpP1 each contain two introns, while 17 genes, including rpl2, trnL-CAA, ycf2, and ndhB are present in duplicate, whereas rps19 is present as a single copy, reflecting structural conservation and evolutionary mechanisms such as intron retention and gene duplication. Comparative genomic analysis revealed substantial variations both among Stellaria species and in the formerly classified Stellaria dichotoma var. lanceolata. Codon usage showed a biasness toward codons ending with A/U, with leucine being most frequently encoded amino acid.

40841702,DNA Sequence Perplexity Reveals Evolutionarily Conserved Patterns in cis-Regulatory Regions Across Diverse Species.,"Deciphering cis-regulatory regions in genomes is essential for understanding various physiological processes and pathological mechanisms. Regulatory signatures, namely promoter motifs, transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, GC content, CpG islands, DNA structural motifs, and other cis-regulatory features, are well-established for their roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these features often exhibit species-specific variations, challenging the identification of conserved regulatory principles across different genomes. In this study, we introduce DNA sequence perplexity as an innovative and efficient information-theoretic metric for characterizing cis-regulatory regions. Derived from information theory and natural language processing, perplexity quantifies the complexity and predictability of sequence, offering a motif-independent framework for DNA analysis. By examining transcription and translation start site regions across 1180 species spanning diverse taxa, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory regions consistently exhibit lower perplexity compared to adjacent flanking regions. This trend persists irrespective of taxonomic classification, establishing perplexity as an evolutionarily conserved pattern of regulatory DNA. Additionally, we observe an inverse correlation between perplexity and promoter strength in yeast datasets, suggesting that higher transcriptional outputs are associated with markedly reduced sequence perplexity.

40913693,Exploring EZH2-Linked lncRNAs in Gastric Cancer: Insights from Sequencing Data and Gene Modulation.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a methyl-transferase and master transcriptional regulator frequently overexpresses in a variety of malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in regulating gene expression and are intricately involved in the EZH2 oncogenic regulatory network. We aimed in this study to investigate the expression of EZH2-associated lncRNAs and their probable regulatory role in GC progression. RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data from 375 tumor and 32 normal samples were retrieved from the TCGA database. Differential expression and correlation analyses were performed to identify EZH2-associated lncRNAs. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network comprising lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs was constructed and visualized. Functional genomics analysis including EZH2 knockdown and induced overexpression experiments were carried out in AGS and MKN-45 GC cell lines to validate the expression of selected lncRNAs using RT-qPCR. EZH2-correlated analysis revealed 16 upregulated and 8 downregulated lncRNAs with significant associations. EZH2 expression modulation studies confirmed that expression levels of lncRNAs including PVT1, MNX1-AS1, AC103702.2, PCAT7, LINC01235, LINC02086, MIR99AHG, and MAGI2-AS3 were regulated by EZH2 in GC cells. EZH2 modulates the expression of several key lncRNAs associated with gastric cancer progression, suggesting that the EZH2/lncRNA axis could serve as a potential therapeutic target. Targeting this axis may open new avenues for influencing critical molecular pathways involved in GC development.","Masoudi Kazemabad, Ali; Safaralizadeh, Reza; Haghi, Mehdi; Forghanifard, Mohammad Mahdi","Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.

40911248,Identification of pathogenic variants in six Chinese families with keratoconus of autosomal dominant inheritance: pathogenicity analysis and variable phenotype.,"Keratoconus (KC) is a bilateral, asymmetric disease causing corneal thinning, irregular astigmatism, and vision decline, with unclear etiology. This study aims to investigate pathogenic variants of candidate genes in Chinese KC families via whole exome sequencing (WES). The Pentacam 3D anterior segment analysis system was applied for keratectasia detection, and the Corvis ST was used for corneal biomechanics measurement. Probands from KC families were screened via WES and further verified in other family members through Sanger sequencing. Additionally, qPCR was used to validate copy number variants and identify pathogenic gene loci. The identified variants were then classified according to the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants published by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Finally, STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis was performed to investigate interactions among candidate gene-related proteins. Using WES, four heterozygous missense variants were detected in the ZNF469, KRT12, COL8A2, and COL18A1 genes: c.4384G > A: p.Asp1462Asn, c.1229T > G:p.Val410Gly, c.505A > G:p.Ile169Val, and c.1159G > A:p.Gly387Arg. Additionally, a heterozygous frameshift variant was detected in the PMS2 gene: c.1551_1572del:p.Ser517Argfs*71. The affected parents carried the same variants as the probands verified by Sanger sequencing. A copy number variant was detected in the DPP6 gene: seq[GRCh38] dup(7)(q36.2q36.2) chr7:g.153782360_ 153982491dup. According to ACMG guidelines, ZNF469, KRT12, COL8A2, and COL18A1 gene variants are Likely Pathogenic; PMS2 and DPP6 gene variants are Pathogenic. STRING analysis highlights a tightly interconnected network centered on COL8A2, involving COL18A1, FN1, ZNF469, and KRT12. DPP6 was involved in KC via affecting FN1. In four of six autosomal dominant KC (adKC) families, affected parents had the same variants as probands but milder phenotypes. In this study, six novel variants in ZNF469, KRT12, COL8A2, COL18A1, PMS2, and DPP6 were linked to adKC. Family phenotypes showed variable expressivity with irregular dominance inheritance. Abnormal KC-related gene protein expression may contribute to corneal structural instability. This study broadened KC genetic screening candidates and suggested genetic testing could aid early KC diagnosis and intervention.","Huang, Xiaoyu; Ma, Meijiao; Chen, Xiaofei; Lian, Yuanyuan; Li, Huiping; Sheng, Xunlun","Gansu Aier Ophthalmology and Optometry Hospital, Lanzhou, China.; Gansu Aier Ophthalmology and Optometry Hospital, Lanzhou, China. shengxunlun@163.com.; Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.; People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Third Clinical Medical College of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China. shengxunlun@163.com.; People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Third Clinical Medical College of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.

40920217,Revolution and advances in gene editing and genomics technology for developing climate-resilient legume crops: developments and prospects.,"Legumes are essential for agriculture and food security. Biotic and abiotic stresses pose significant challenges to legume production, lowering productivity levels. Most legumes must be genetically improved by introducing alleles that give pest and disease resistance, abiotic stress adaptability, and high yield potential. The quickest way to develop high-yielding elite legume varieties with long-lasting resistance is to tap into potential resistance alleles present in landraces and wild relatives and exploit them in legume resistance breeding programs using next-generation molecular breeding methods. Most of the reviews focus on the advancements made by genome editing technologies in generating climate-tolerant legumes for breeding. This review discusses the challenges of genome-based editing tools and how the integration of other popular breeding methodologies, such as QTLs and GWAS, as well as computational techniques, can aid in the development of climate-tolerant legume crops. This review highlights genomics-based methodologies and recent advances that make it easier to assess genetic diversity and uncover adaptive genes in legumes. Computational approaches, such as machine learning, are important in mining the breeding-related genes identified by CRISPR and other genomic tools, as well as detecting the key elements and factors that regulate the expression of these genes, which addresses the challenge of developing climate-resilient legume crops.","Mishra, Gayatri","Institute of Biological Chemistry, The Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164, USA. gayatri.mishra@wsu.edu.",Plant molecular biology,Plant Mol Biol,"Gene Editing, Crops, Agricultural, Genomics, Fabaceae, Plant Breeding, Genome, Plant, Quantitative Trait Loci, Climate",2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40920217,10.1007/s11103-025-01637-y,40920217,0,0,NONE

40801968,Beyond the Mouse: The Mouse Lemur as a New Primate Model for Cardiovascular Research.,"Due to differences in cardiac structure and function, it has become increasingly clear that many aspects of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and disease are not well modeled in mice. This has spurred a search for new model organisms with the practical advantages of mice but that more closely mimic human biology and disease. Until recently, little was known of lemur cardiovascular physiology, cell types, or pathology. In a recent trinity of papers, we established the mouse lemur (Microcebus spp.) - the world's smallest, most prolific, and among the most abundant non-human primates - and the cheapest and easiest to maintain, as a new tractable genetic model organism. In one of these studies, we conducted the first systematic phenotypic screen and classical genetic mapping in a non-human primate, leading to the identification and characterization of human-like cardiac arrhythmias. We successfully genetically mapped one familial lemur arrhythmia to a novel disease gene. In the other two studies, we built and applied a transcriptomic cell atlas for the mouse lemur, profiling 226,000 cells across 27 organs. This included the transcriptomic profiles of over 4000 cardiac cells, identifying 15 heart cell types that included several rare heart cell types. We documented the first null mutations in lemur, including nonsense mutations in three primate genes absent in mice, and exploited the atlas to reveal their transcriptional phenotypes, demonstrating the potential of the model organism along with synergy with the atlas. To propel these advances, we recently generated a new near telomere-to-telomere (T2T), phased diploid genome assembly for the mouse lemur, using a combination of short-, long-, and ultralong-read sequencing technologies - providing a foundational genomic resource to enhance gene and mutation discovery, functional genomics, and the applicability of cell atlas data in this new primate model. This review examines the mouse lemur (Microcebus species) as a new tractable genetic model organism for investigating primate-specific cardiovascular function and disease. Recent studies from our lab have laid a robust cellular, molecular, and genomic foundation for this model, including the first systematic phenotypic screens and classical genetic mapping in a non-human primate, showing that both forward and reverse genetic approaches are now feasible in lemurs. Collectively, these advances present a compelling case for the mouse lemur as a valuable and practical model organism for primate biomedical research.","Chang, Stephen","Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. scthree@stanford.edu.; Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Beckman Center B400, 279 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA, USA. scthree@stanford.edu.",Current cardiology reports,Curr Cardiol Rep,"Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Cheirogaleidae, Mice, Humans, Cardiovascular Diseases",2025,08,13,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40801968,10.1007/s11886-025-02276-x,40801968,0,,
40820056,Challenging Reward Structures and Organizational Cultures that Propagate Stem Cell Hyperbole.,"How science is communicated shapes public understanding of science and informs decision-making by patients, research participants, policymakers, public funding agencies, private philanthropic organizations, and corporations. Responsible science communication is a collective responsibility of scientists. Accurate reporting is also a crucial feature of news media coverage of scientific research. Unfortunately, scientists, journalists, and other parties sometimes make hyperbolic claims that go beyond available evidence and exaggerate the significance of particular research findings. This phenomenon is evident in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, though hyperbolic representations have also been documented in such fields as artificial intelligence, genomics, precision medicine, and synthetic biology. Stem cell hyperbole is shaped and promoted by systemic factors. We highlight the continued significance of responsible communication of stem cell science across news media and social media, especially in an era where there are powerful incentives to make hyperbolic claims. While such norms as truthfulness, accuracy, and accountability might seem self-evident, contemporary incentive structures and organizational cultures play an important role in promoting hyperbolic representations and other inaccurate representations of scientific research. Finally, we propose recommendations for supporting and sustaining research cultures that prioritize honesty and accuracy in science communication and public engagement.","Trinh, Annie; Turner, Leigh","Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA. leigh.turner@uci.edu.; Department of Health, Society, and Behavior, Joe C.

40917581,Enhancing Genetic Risk Prediction through Federated Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning with Inaccurate Electronic Health Record Data.,"Large-scale genomics data combined with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) illuminate the path towards personalized disease management and enhanced medical interventions. However, the absence of ""gold standard"" disease labels makes the development of machine learning models a challenging task. Additionally, imbalances in demographic representation within datasets compromise the development of unbiased healthcare solutions. In response to these challenges, we introduce FEderated Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning (FEST) for improving disease risk predictions in underrepresented populations. FEST facilitates the collaborative training of models across various institutions by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data from diverse subpopulations. It addresses distributional variations across different populations and healthcare institutions by combining density ratio reweighting and model calibration techniques. Federated learning algorithms are developed for training models using only summary-level statistics. We perform simulation studies to assess the efficacy of FEST in comparisons with a few alternative methods. Subsequently, we apply FEST to training a genetic risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes that targets the African-Ancestry population using data from the Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB) Biobank. Both our computational experiments and real-world data application underline the superior performance of FEST over competing methods.","Lu, Yuying; Gu, Tian; Duan, Rui","Department of Biostatistics, Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

By synthesizing evidence from recent literature and clinical reports, we highlight the capabilities, limitations, and translational potential of AI techniques across key imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and PET. Deep learning (DL) and radiomics have facilitated automated lesion detection, tumour segmentation, and prognostic assessments, improving early cancer detection across various malignancies, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers. AI-driven multi-modal imaging fusion integrates radiomics, genomics, and clinical data, refining precision oncology strategies. Additionally, AI-assisted radiotherapy planning and adaptive dose optimisation have enhanced therapeutic efficacy while minimising toxicity. However, challenges persist regarding data heterogeneity, model generalisability, regulatory constraints, and ethical concerns. The lack of standardised datasets and explainable AI (XAI) frameworks hinders clinical adoption. Future research should focus on improving AI interpretability, fostering multi-centre dataset interoperability, and integrating AI with molecular imaging and real-time clinical decision support.

40819323,Bibliometric analysis of immunogenic cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"This study aimed to delineate global research trends in immunogenic cell death (ICD) within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by mapping collaborative networks, thematic shifts, and high-impact findings. Using VOSviewer network visualisation and R-bibliometrix quantitative metrics, we sought to show how scientific output has evolved and to pinpoint research gaps that may guide future investigations. We retrieved 568 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (2000-2024) using a tailored keyword strategy encompassing ""Hepatocellular carcinoma"" and ""Immunogenic cell death."" Data were analyzed with VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix to visualize co-authorship patterns, keyword clusters, institutional collaborations, and citation metrics. Annual publication volumes rose markedly, peaking at 68 in 2023, and this quantitative surge parallels a qualitative shift toward clinically actionable research outputs. Over the entire period, the corpus accumulated 13 161 citations (mean 23.2 citations/article), indicating strong and growing academic influence. Keyword co-occurrence revealed three main clusters highlighting immunotherapeutic mechanisms, molecular pathways (e.g., HMGB1 and calreticulin), and epidemiological concerns. China and the United States led in overall output, with universities such as the University of California System, Harvard University, and Shanghai-based institutions forming robust collaborative networks. Highly cited articles, such as Zhong et al. (2016, Cell) on autophagy-inflammation crosstalk and Yu et al. (2020, ACS Nano) on mitophagy-augmented doxorubicin, underscored the role of autophagy, checkpoint inhibitors, and combination therapies in harnessing ICD to overcome HCC's immunosuppressive microenvironment. These patterns indicate that the field is transitioning from descriptive bibliometrics to translational studies, signalling that forthcoming work will likely accelerate rational design of ICD-based clinical trials and inform funding priorities. The findings confirm ICD as an emerging cornerstone of HCC research, with demonstrated capacity to reshape clinical-trial portfolios and refine biomarker-driven patient stratification, reflecting both deeper mechanistic insights and accelerating translational efforts. Ongoing challenges include refining biomarkers, integrating ICD inducers with immunotherapies, and accounting for HCC's inherent complexities such as chronic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction. Future research directions focus on the use of nanotechnology for precise drug delivery, the integration of metabolomics and genomics data to enable personalised treatment, and the improvement of combination therapies combined with local interventions.","Sun, Jianming; Liu, Chun; Liu, Dongdong; Hu, Xinlian; Ren, Shirong; Jiang, Guoying; Zhang, Daizhong; Hu, Shuai; Yuan, Xiaojing; Tao, Jun","Department of Oncology, Chongqing General Hospital, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 401147, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Deyang People's Hospital, Deyang, 618000, China.; Rehabilitation Department, Yibin Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yibin, 644000, China. xingfutj@sina.cn.; Department of General Surgery, Dazhou Central Hospital, Dazhou, 635000, China.; Rehabilitation Department, Yibin Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yibin, 644000, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonggang General Hospital, Chongqing, 400080, China. 17783707881@163.com.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin, 644000, China.",Discover oncology,Discov Oncol,,2025,08,17,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40819323,10.1007/s12672-025-03362-w,40819323,0,,

40813950,"Strengthening Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine in Colombia: Progress, Challenges, and Strategic Opportunities.","Colombia, an upper-middle-income country with over 52 million inhabitants, has made significant progress in consolidating medical genetics as a clinical specialty, with a growing presence in healthcare system, public health and academia. The development of specialized training programs, the establishment of a professional association, and the inclusion of genetic tests and treatments for rare diseases (RDs) within the health system have been key achievements. Birth defects (BD) remain one of the leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality, and alongside RDs, are recognized as public health priorities. Among regulatory milestones, the Newborn Screening (NBS) Law has strengthened early diagnosis efforts. Nevertheless, operational challenges persist, particularly in the nationwide implementation of genetic services, which remain concentrated in urban centers, creating significant gaps in rural areas. While technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are increasingly available in the private sector, a persistent fragmentation between molecular diagnosis and clinical care limits their impact.

Advances in niche adaptation research and whole-genome sequencing have facilitated the screening of functional strains. This study evaluated the potential of <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130, isolated from corn silage, as a superior silage inoculant through genomic analysis. Functional traits of <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130 were characterized. The results revealed that there were diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and sugar-utilization operons in <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130 genome. And, 21 genes encoding adhesion-related proteins were identified in <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130 genome, along with genes associated with heat, cold, and acid stress resistance. In addition, comparative genomics with two food-derived <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> strains elucidated genome plasticity and niche-specific adaptations. Strain-specific genes involved in genomic integration, biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways were identified in the <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130 genome, suggesting its enhanced adaptability to silage conditions. These genomic features, including efficient sugar utilization, adhesion capacity, and robust stress tolerance, collectively demonstrate that <i>Companilactobacillus musae</i> zy130 is better adapt to for silage fermentation.

Despite advancements in therapeutic strategies over the past decades, patient survival has not improved significantly due to underlying genomic heterogeneity, drug resistance, and late-stage diagnosis. Traditional preclinical models have contributed significantly to OSCC research, but often fail to fully recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and patient-specific responses. This review comprehensively outlines the diverse preclinical models used in OSCC research, including two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures, three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, organoids, animal models, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Each model is discussed in terms of its biological relevance, advantages, limitations, and contributions to translational research. Particular attention is given to the emerging potential of organoid systems and PDXs in personalized medicine and high-throughput drug screening. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of integrative approaches combining genomics, proteomics, and pharmacological data to better recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and predict therapeutic response.

40853611,Multi-omics integration reveals CYTL1 and H6PD as key regulators of tumor metabolism in mesothelioma.,"Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Despite advancements in understanding its molecular mechanisms, effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets remain elusive. This study utilizes a multi-omics approach to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. A multi-omics framework integrating druggable genomics, Mendelian randomization (MR), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed. Druggable genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci data, and therapeutic targets were predicted through MR analysis. These targets were cross-referenced with mesothelioma-specific single-cell markers and validated by summary data-based MR and protein quantitative trait loci analysis. Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were used to explore functional mechanisms. Drug sensitivity was assessed with the GDSC2 dataset, and potential therapeutic compounds were identified through molecular docking simulations using the Drug Signature Database. Mediated MR analysis investigated 731 immune cells and 1,400 metabolites as mediators of the identified genes' effects on mesothelioma. CYTL1 and H6PD were identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for mesothelioma. CYTL1 was associated with poor prognosis and reduced drug sensitivity, while H6PD showed the opposite trend. Although molecular docking results for H6PD were unfavorable, compounds targeting CYTL1 were identified. Immune cells did not mediate the effects of either gene on mesothelioma progression, despite their prognostic associations. Metabolic mediation analysis revealed that CYTL1 influences mesothelioma via levulinoylcarnitine levels, whereas H6PD regulates tumor metabolism through the mannose-to-mannitol-to-sorbitol ratio and glutamate-to-5-oxoproline ratio. This study identifies CYTL1 and H6PD as key regulators of tumor metabolism in mesothelioma. CYTL1 is a promising therapeutic target, warranting further investigation, while H6PD remains a potential candidate despite unfavorable docking results. These findings demonstrate the value of multi-omics approaches in identifying novel therapeutic targets for mesothelioma.","Ma, Jiao; Zhang, Huilin; Yu, Luanxue; Guo, Yunqing; Ming, Jiawei; Guo, Zhenying","Department of Surgical Pathology, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Zhejiang Provincial Clinical Research Center for Malignant Tumor, Hangzhou, China. guozy@zjcc.org.cn.; Jing Hengyi School of Education, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Pathology, Zhejiang Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.; Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (Affiliated People's Hospital), Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China. guozy@zjcc.org.cn.",Genes & genomics,Genes Genomics,,2025,08,25,2025,08,25,82072577_NONE_This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40853611,10.1007/s13258-025-01667-2,40853611,0,0,NONE
40784926,An updated molecular toolkit for genomics-assisted breeding of waxy sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench].,"Several mutations of the sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASE (GBSS) gene [Sobic.010G022600; commonly known as Waxy (Wx)] result in a low amylose:amylopectin starch ratio. Recessive waxy (wx) alleles improve starch digestibility in ethanol production, human foods and beverages, and animal feed. However, breeding waxy sorghum is challenging due to reliance on traditional PCR markers for genotyping, which are not amenable to next-generation sequencing (NGS). Most commercial breeding programs use high-throughput genotyping and genomic selection in large, segregating populations prior to flowering. This study provides the first published NGS markers for the two most commonly used waxy (wx) alleles of sorghum and is the first to fully sequence the large insertion that is causal of the wx<sup>a</sup> allele. In the absence of a pangenome including wx<sup>a</sup> genotypes, we constructed an in silico B.Tx623 wx<sup>a</sup> genome assembly from the B.Tx623 reference genome (v3.1.1) including the insertion, a ~ 5-kb-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon of the copia superfamily. The in silico wx<sup>a</sup> assembly improved read mapping at Sobic.010G022600 in wx<sup>a</sup> individuals, identified 78 new uniquely mapped reads, and made it possible to distinguish different Waxy genotypes using short-read sequencing data. Functional PACE-PCR markers, suitable for marker-assisted selection and multiplexed, low-to-mid-density genomic selection, were developed for Wx, wx<sup>a</sup>, and wx<sup>b</sup> alleles. The PACE markers were validated in segregating populations of three public and private breeding programs. These new molecular breeding resources comprise a toolkit that will improve the efficiency of developing commercial waxy sorghum hybrids using genomics-assisted approaches.","Yerka, Melinda K; Liu, Zhiyuan; Bean, Scott; Nigam, Deepti; Hayes, Chad; Druetto, Diego; Krishnamoorthy, Gabriel; Meiwes, Shelley; Cucit, Gonzalo; Patil, Gunvant B; Jiao, Yinping","USDA-ARS Grain Quality and Structure Research Unit, Manhattan, KS, USA.; Institute of Genomics for Crop Abiotic Stress Tolerance (IGCAST), Plant and Soil Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA.; Nuseed, Laverton, VIC, Australia.; Institute of Genomics for Crop Abiotic Stress Tolerance (IGCAST), Plant and Soil Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA. yjiao@ttu.edu.; USDA-ARS Plant Stress and Germplasm Development Research Unit, Lubbock, TX, USA.; Richardson Seeds Ltd., Vega, TX, USA.; Department of Agriculture, Veterinary & Rangeland Sciences, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV, USA. myerka@unr.edu.",Journal of applied genetics,J Appl Genet,,2025,08,11,2025,08,10,NEV00763_NONE_National Institute of Food and Agriculture_; 2019-67014-29174_NONE_National Institute of Food and Agriculture_; 3096-21000-024-000-D_NONE_Agricultural Research Service_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40784926,10.1007/s13353-025-00993-1,40784926,0,,

We present a high-quality, complete de novo genome assembly of T. alba DSM43795<sup>T</sup> using combined PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing, resulting in a single circular chromosome of 4.9 Mbp with 72.1% GC content. Comparative genomics with the thermophilic relative T. fusca YX revealed 83.39% average nucleotide identity and extensive genome synteny alongside niche-specific differences. Functional annotation identified 4345 genes, including a rich complement of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), esterases, and polysaccharide lyases, supporting versatile plant biomass degradation. GH gene sets were largely conserved between the species in both gene number and distribution, but T. alba uniquely encodes a novel GH10 endo-xylanase near a characterised palindrome regulatory sequence, indicating species-specific regulation. We hypothesise that thermophilic adaptation in T. fusca requires more proteins for ribosome integrity and amino acid metabolism, with reduced emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism and defence compared to T. alba. Moreover, T. alba harbours a broader array of defence-related genes and mobile genetic elements, including integrases and transposases. Although lacking a complete CRISPR-Cas system, two CRISPR arrays were detected, suggesting alternative immune strategies. Virulence factor homologs shared by both species likely reflect environmental survival rather than pathogenicity. This genomic characterisation elucidates T. alba's metabolic versatility and ecological adaptations, laying the groundwork for its potential applications in biomass conversion, environmental biotechnology, and drug discovery.","Luzics, Szabina; Baka, Erzsébet; Otto, Margot; Kosztik, Judit; Szalontai, Helga; Bata-Vidács, Ildikó; Nagy, István; Tóth, Ákos; Táncsics, András; Pápai, Márton; Nagy, István; Orsini, Massimiliano; Kukolya, József","Institute of Biology, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, 1053, Hungary.; Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 82152, Martinsried, Germany.; South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Centre of Research and Development, Eszterházy Károly Catholic University, Eger, 3300, Hungary.; Laboratory of Microbial Ecology and Genomics, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Delle Venezie, 35020, Legnaro, Italy.; Heart and Vascular Center, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.; Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Centre, HUN-REN, Szeged, 6726, Hungary.; Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI), Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.; Department of Molecular Ecology, Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gödöllő, 2100, Hungary.; Seqomics Biotechnology Ltd., Mórahalom, 6782, Hungary.; Department of Molecular Ecology, Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Gödöllő, 2100, Hungary. baka.erzsebet@uni-mate.hu.",Biologia futura,Biol Futur,,2025,08,20,2025,08,20,"EKÖP-MATE/2024/25/D_NONE_Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund_; K142686_NONE_National Research, Development and Innovation Office_; EKÖP- 24- VI/MATE-3_NONE_Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40835811,10.1007/s42977-025-00283-1,40835811,0,0,NONE
40919476,"Picocyanobacteria in the Chesapeake Bay: isolation, diversity, and adaptation.","Tiny unicellular cyanobacteria or picocyanobacteria (0.5-3 µm) are important due to their ecological significance. Chesapeake Bay is a temperate estuary that contains abundant and diverse picocyanobacteria. Studies of Chesapeake Bay picocyanobacteria in the past 20 years led to the finding of new members of subcluster 5.2 <i>Synechococcus</i>. They laid the foundation for revealing the ecophysiology, biogeography, genomics, and molecular evolution of picocyanobacterial in the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal estuaries. The Bay picocyanobacteria are known to better tolerate the changes in temperature, salinity, and heavy metals compared to their coastal and open-ocean counterparts. Many picocyanobacteria isolated from the Bay contain rich toxin-antitoxin (TA) genes, suggesting that the TA system may provide them with a genetic advance to cope with variable estuarine environments. Distinct winter and summer picocyanobacteria are present in the Bay, suggesting a dynamic seasonal shift of the picocyanobacterial community in the temperate estuary. While the Bay contains subcluster 5.2 <i>Synechococcus</i>, it also contains freshwater <i>Synechococcus</i>, <i>Cyanobium,</i> and marine <i>Synechococcus</i> due to river influx and the ocean's tidal influence. Some Chesapeake Bay picocyanobacterial clades were found in the Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea, showing a link between the Bay and polar picocyanobacteria. Genomic sequences of estuarine picocyanobacteria provide new insight into the taxonomy and evolution of freshwater, estuarine, and marine unicellular cyanobacteria.

However, little is known about the biology and ecology of this species. In this study, the presence of a fine-scale population structure and genetic diversity of queen snapper from Puerto Rico was assessed through 16,188 SNPs derived from the Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) technique. Summary statistics estimated low genetic diversity (HO = 0.333-0.264) and did not reveal population differentiation within our samples (<i>F</i> <sub>ST</sub> = - 0.001-0.025). Principal component analysis and a model-based clustering method did not detect a fine-scale subpopulation structure among sampling sites, however, there was genetic variability within regions and sites. Our results have revealed comparable genetic and dispersal patterns to those observed in other shallow-water snapper species in Puerto Rico waters.

40919462,Integrating hotspot dynamics and centers of diversity: a review of Indo-Australian Archipelago biogeographic evolution and conservation.,"The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) is the world's preeminent marine biodiversity hotspot, distinguished by its exceptional species richness in tropical shallow waters. This biodiversity has spurred extensive research into its evolutionary and biogeographic origins. Two prominent theoretical frameworks dominate explanations for the IAA's biodiversity: the ""centers-of hypotheses"" and the ""hopping hotspot hypothesis"". The ""centers-of hypotheses"" posits that specific regions serve as key sources of IAA biodiversity, either through the accumulation and overlap of species from external areas or via elevated rates of local speciation. In contrast, the ""hopping hotspot hypothesis"" asserts that biodiversity hotspots are dynamic, shifting across geological timescales in response to tectonic and environmental changes. This review synthesizes these contrasting perspectives into an integrated framework, the ""Dynamic Centers Hypothesis,"" which proposes that as biodiversity hotspots migrate over time, the IAA's role in generating and sustaining biodiversity has evolved, with varying contributions from different sources dominating distinct historical phases. By synthesizing the evidence for both hypotheses and incorporating recent findings, including fossil and phylogeography data, we propose the ""Dynamic Centers Hypothesis"" as a comprehensive and unifying explanation for the IAA's biodiversity. The review further explores biogeographic delineation, aligning tropical marine realms with the IAA's evolutionary trajectory, from its Tethyan roots to its modern Indo-West Pacific dominance. Looking forward, advances in DNA barcoding and genomics are uncovering vast cryptic diversity, revolutionizing our comprehension of IAA phylogeographic history. These discoveries underscore the imperative for a multidimensional conservation framework, integrating phylogenetic, and functional diversity, to preserve this biodiversity hotspot amid escalating global change.","Huang, Mingpan; Lawes, Michael J; Zhou, Wenliang; Wei, Fuwen","School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Scottsville, 3209 South Africa.; Center for Evolution and Conservation Biology, Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, 511458 China.; Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology, College of Forestry, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, 330045 China.; Institute of Biodiversity and Environmental Conservation (IBEC), Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, 94300 Kota Samarahan, Sarawak Malaysia.; CAS Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and Conservation Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101 China.",Marine life science & technology,Mar Life Sci Technol,,2025,07,30,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40919462,10.1007/s42995-025-00313-w,40919462,0,0,NONE

40818855,Disentangling the multi-omics layers of complex traits: Celiac disease as a model.,"The post-genomic era has ushered in a transformative shift in biomedical research, driven by the integration of multi-omics technologies and advanced computational tools. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants linked to complex traits and diseases, the majority of these lie in non-coding regions, where their functional roles remain elusive. This chapter explores how fine-mapping, functional genomics, and systems biology are converging to bridge this gap, moving from statistical associations to mechanistic insights. Using celiac disease as a model, we illustrate how genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data can be harmonized to identify causal variants, prioritize candidate genes, and map regulatory networks that drive disease pathogenesis. We highlight the power of fine-mapping in refining GWAS signals and the importance of integrating chromatin accessibility, QTL colocalization, and single-cell omics to contextualize genetic risk within specific cellular environments. The chapter also discusses the promise of polygenic risk scores, the role of metabolomics in capturing functional phenotypes, and the emergence of single-cell and spatial technologies in revealing disease heterogeneity. Despite these advances, challenges remain-including data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and the underrepresentation of non-European populations in genomic studies. Addressing these issues will be critical for ensuring the equity and clinical utility of precision medicine. Ultimately, this chapter underscores the transformative potential of translational genomics. By connecting genetic variation to molecular function and clinical outcome, multi-omics approaches are paving the way for more predictive, preventive, and personalized healthcare-particularly in the context of autoimmune and other complex diseases.","Cerqueira, Juliana Xavier de Miranda","Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Celiac Disease Research Center, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland; Faculty of Nutrition and Food Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.

We identified 212 putative candidate genes associated with MASLD by using data from a large multi-ancestry genetic association study, of which 158 (74.5%) were previously unreported. From this set, we identified 57 genes that encode for druggable protein targets and for which the effects of increasing genetically predicted gene expression on MASLD risk align with the function of that drug on the protein target. We then used We then evaluated these potential targets for evidence of efficacy by using Mendelian randomization, pathway analysis, and protein structural modeling.

40829598,When two plus four does not equal six: Combining computational and functional evidence to classify BRCA1 key domain missense substitutions.,"Classification of genetic variants remains an obstacle to realizing the full potential of clinical genetic sequencing. Because of their ability to interrogate large numbers of variants, multiplexed assays of variant effect and computational tools are viewed as a critical part of the solution to variant classification uncertainty. However, the (joint) performance of these assays and tools on novel variants has not been established. Transformation of the qualitative classification guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) into a quantitative Bayesian point system enables empirical validation of strength of evidence assigned to evidence criteria. Here, we derived a maximum-likelihood estimate model that converts frequentist odds ratios calculated from case-control data to proportions pathogenic and applied this model to functional assays, alone and in combination with computational tools across several domains of BRCA1. Furthermore, we defined exceptionally conserved ancestral residues (ECARs) and interrogated the performance of assays and tools at these residues in BRCA1. We found that missense substitutions in BRCA1 that fall at ECARs are disproportionately likely to be pathogenic with effect sizes similar to that of protein-truncating variants. In contrast, for substitutions falling at non-ECAR positions, concordant predictions of pathogenicity from functional assays and computational tools often fail to meet the additive assumptions of strength in ACMG guidelines. Thus, collectively, we conclude that strengths of evidence assigned by expert opinion in the ACMG guidelines are not universally applicable and require empirical validation.","Pew, Scott T; Wiffler, Madison B; Thomas, Alun; Boyle, Julie L; Cline, Melissa S; Camp, Nicola J; Goldgar, David E; Tavtigian, Sean V","Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Department of Neurobiology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA; Department of Dermatology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.; Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.

40845847,"SPINK1-related chronic pancreatitis: A model that encapsulates the spectrum of variant effects, genetic complexity, and classificatory challenges.","The widely used American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) variant classification system is inherently limited by its binary categorization of variants as ""pathogenic"" or ""benign,"" failing to account for the full spectrum of variant effects within the complex genetic architecture of human disease. Although various refinements have been proposed, a framework that adequately captures this continuum remains to be established. To address this limitation, we conducted an in-depth analysis of SPINK1 variants associated with chronic pancreatitis (CP), a disorder ranging from Mendelian to environmentally influenced forms. We collated and reviewed SPINK1 variants identified in both genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and non-GWASs. Focusing on predicted loss-of-function (LoF) and experimentally characterized variants, we demonstrated through aggregation analysis that complete- or near-complete-LoF SPINK1 variants cause autosomal-dominant disease with moderate penetrance (∼55%). This finding establishes a critical baseline for comprehensively deciphering the genetic complexity underlying SPINK1-related CP. Concentrating on two well-characterized partial-LoF (hypomorphic) variants, c.194+2T>C and c.-4141G>T (enhancer), we present converging evidence for a distinct variant category that neither aligns with the ACMG/AMP binary classifications nor fits the recently proposed ""risk alleles"" category. Although some variants remain classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs), we propose a refined classificatory framework that integrates ""risk,"" ""predisposing,"" and ""pathogenic"" variants to accommodate the full spectrum of clinically relevant SPINK1 variants. This refined framework is expected to serve as a model for variant interpretation beyond SPINK1, providing insights into the issue of ""missing heritability"" and fostering further exploration of variant effects and genetic complexity across different contexts of human disease.","Wang, Yuan-Chen; Masson, Emmanuelle; Wang, Qi-Wen; Génin, Emmanuelle; Le Gac, Gérald; Fichou, Yann; Cooper, David N; Liao, Zhuan; Férec, Claude; Zou, Wen-Bin; Chen, Jian-Min","University Brest, Inserm, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, 29200 Brest, France; Service de Génétique Médicale et de Biologie de la Reproduction, CHU Brest, 29200 Brest, France.; Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.; University Brest, Inserm, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, 29200 Brest, France.; University Brest, Inserm, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, 29200 Brest, France.

40865752,Whole-Genome Sequencing for the Prenatal Evaluation of Fetal Structural Anomalies: A prospective multicenter study.,"The clinical validity of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in postnatal settings is well documented, but studies of its use in prenatal settings are limited. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the performance of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for prenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies compared with the commonly used testing strategy of copy-number variant sequencing (CNV-seq) plus exome sequencing (ES). WGS was performed in parallel with CNV-seq and ES for 96 parent-fetus trios with fetal structural anomalies. Single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, copy-number variations, structural variants, and absence of heterozygosity were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular Pathology, and ClinGen guidelines. Diagnostic variants were found by CNV-seq for 5/96 (5.2%) fetuses and by trio-ES for 26/96 (27.1%) fetuses. The combined diagnostic rate for CNV-seq plus trio-ES was 30/96 (31.2%). Trio-WGS identified all diagnostic variants detected by CNV-seq and trio-ES plus three additional fetuses (one with maternal UPD15, one with a complex chromosomal rearrangement and one with compound heterozygous SNVs in NADSYN1), increasing the diagnostic rate to 33/96 (34.4%). The highest diagnostic rate was observed in fetuses with craniofacial abnormalities (2/3, 66.7%), followed by those with hydrops (3/6, 50.0%). Ten families (10.5%, 10/96) were detected with incidental findings, of which, structural variants in seven fetuses were detected only by trio-WGS, including six inversions and one UPD16. Trio-based WGS offers a valid alternative to CNV-seq plus ES, demonstrating the capacity for more comprehensive genomic analysis for fetuses with structural anomalies while permitting consolidation of laboratory workflows into a single test.","Gao, Zhi; Liu, Meimei; Jiang, Jinna; Yang, Xiaofeng; Li, Yimei; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Yanfei; Hua, Chunxiao; Liu, Ning; Zhu, Xiaofan; Kong, Xiangdong","Genetics and Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) and the development of drug resistance pose significant challenges to effective cancer therapy. This review explores the integration of multi-omics proteomic approaches to decipher the complex interactions within the TME and the mechanisms driving resistance in PCa. We discuss how proteomics and genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics enhance our understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer progression, immune evasion, and treatment failure. Emphasis is placed on recent advances in proteomic profiling of the TME, including extracellular matrix components and immune regulators, and how single-cell proteomics provides insights into tumor heterogeneity. We also highlight the multi-omics role in identifying post-translational modifications and kinase pathways contributing to therapeutic resistance, and its implications for biomarker discovery and personalized medicine. The review concludes by addressing the clinical potential of multi-omics approaches and their future role in improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients.","Wang, Yutao; Wang, Fan; Pan, Qi; Wang, Jianfeng","Department of Organ Transplantation and Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China; The Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation in Liaoning Province, Shenyang 110001, China.; Department of Urology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China; Institute of Urology, China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.

40850376,Discrimination and dendritic cell abundance among older adults in the health and retirement study.,"We investigated whether peripheral blood dendritic cell (DC) abundance varies as a function of discrimination exposure in a national sample of older US adults (aged 50 + years) from the 2016 Venous Blood Study, a US Health and Retirement Study biomarker project. Density of myeloid DCs (mDC) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) were measured using multiparameter flow cytometry. Discrimination was assessed using the validated Everyday Discrimination Scale. Weighted linear regression models quantified associations between discrimination and natural-log transformed DC abundance, controlling for sociodemographic factors, chronic health conditions, and health behaviors. We tested whether these associations varied by race/ethnicity. For mDC, we found no significant overall association with discrimination. However, race/ethnicity significantly modified this relationship: among non-Hispanic White participants, a 1-SD increase in discrimination was associated with a non-significant 1.4 % increase in mDC count (p = 0.20), while non-Hispanic Black participants showed a significant 4.6 % decrease (interaction p = 0.021). For pDC, a 1-SD change in discrimination was significantly associated with a 2.4 % increase in abundance across all participants (95 % CI: 0.6 %, 4.3 %, p = 0.010), with no significant effect modification by race/ethnicity. In this nationally representative study of older Americans, discrimination exposure was associated with altered dendritic cell abundance, with distinct patterns by cell type and race/ethnicity. Increased pDC counts across all racial/ethnic groups suggest a common immunological response to discrimination, while divergent mDC responses between non-Hispanic Black and White participants indicate race-specific immune modulation. These findings reveal complex cellular pathways through which discrimination may differentially influence immune function and contribute to health inequities.","Bather, Jemar R; Kranz, Emiko O; Rodrigues, Mariana; Cole, Steven W; Cuevas, Adolfo G","Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Center for Anti-racism, Social Justice & Public Health, New York University School of Global Public Health, New York, NY, USA; Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, New York University School of Global Public Health, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Anti-racism, Social Justice & Public Health, New York University School of Global Public Health, New York, NY, USA; Department of Biostatistics, New York University School of Global Public Health, New York, NY, USA.

40845435,Integrated subtractive genomics and inhibitor identification of novel FAD-dependent monooxygenase in Nocardia farcinica JJSBBCNF_01.,"Nocardia farcinica is among the most common Nocardia species responsible for human nocardiosis. This study aims to identify potential drug targets involved in unique metabolic pathways of N. farcinica using a subtractive genomics approach and to prioritize potential inhibitors through structural bioinformatics. Compared to previous studies, this work integrates a subtractive genomics pipeline with diverse compound libraries and comprehensive molecular simulations, offering a more targeted and robust approach to drug discovery. The subtractive approach was applied to the pathogen's whole genome based on several criteria, including non-homology to human proteins, essentiality, druggability, subcellular localization, and virulence. The selected druggable targets were further analyzed using high-throughput virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulations. Among the four potent druggable targets identified, the FAD-dependent monooxygenase emerged as a promising novel therapeutic target. Virtual screening of CMNPD, MNPD, Seaweed, and Specs compound libraries revealed five promising therapeutic candidates based on their ADME profiles and binding affinities. Notably, the SeaweedBS009 compound demonstrated the highest therapeutic potential due to its stability throughout the molecular dynamics simulation and its lowest binding free energy. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel drugs targeting pathogen-specific metabolic pathways in N. farcinica. The identified drug targets and lead compounds could facilitate the design of effective therapeutics to combat drug-resistant N. farcinica infections.","Nathar, Shaslinah; Nagarajan, Hemavathy; Narthanareeswaran, Bhuvaneswari; Subramaniyan, Sneha; Pandian, Chitra Jeyaraj; Jeyaraman, Jeyakanthan","Structural Biology and Bio-Computing Lab, Department of Bioinformatics, Alagappa University, Science Block, Karaikudi, 630 003, Tamil Nadu, India.

Here, we conducted adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) under mannitol-exclusive conditions using four different Y. lipolytica strains followed by integrative genetic and transcriptomic analyses. These strains exhibited markedly enhanced mannitol assimilation and growth of upwards of 22-fold increase in utilization. Whole-genome sequencing and reverse engineering revealed that a point mutation in STA1 (A403T), encoding glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase, contributed to improved growth. Transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of MFE2, associated with peroxisomal β-oxidation, and downregulation of DGA1, a key gene for triacylglycerol synthesis, indicating a systems-level metabolic shift that favors energy mobilization over storage lipid accumulation. When cultivated in OMWW-derived media, the evolved strains achieved two-fold higher lipid production compared to its parental strain from mannitol and simultaneously reduced the chemical oxygen demand (COD) by 90 %. Taken together, these findings expand the genetic and regulatory landscape underlying mannitol assimilation in Y. lipolytica and demonstrate the potential of evolved strains for bioconversion of waste-derived substrates into valuable biochemicals.","Gordillo Sierra, Angela R; Yook, Sangdo; Coleman, Sarah; Bansal, Mayur; Alper, Hal S","McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 200 E Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, 2500 Speedway Avenue, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 200 E Dean Keeton St., Austin, TX 78712 USA; Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Austin, 2500 Speedway Avenue, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

40812747,Advances in molecular tools for parasitic nematodes of animals - From genetic markers to metabarcoding and genomics.,"Parasitic nematodes are globally important pathogens of animals, humans and plants. The accurate identification and characterisation of these nematodes are essential for diagnostics, systematics and epidemiological surveillance. Over the past decades, molecular technologies have progressed from targeted PCR-based assays using nuclear ribosomal markers - particularly the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) - to high-throughput metabarcoding and genome-enabled approaches. These advances have transformed species discovery, facilitated the detection of cryptic taxa and supported the development of sensitive diagnostic tools for parasitic nematodes of veterinary, medical and agricultural importance. This review traces the progression of molecular technologies used to study parasitic nematodes, with emphasis on the definition and validation of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA markers, metabarcoding frameworks, such as the ""nemabiome"", and the expanding availability of genomic resources. Particular attention is given to the emergence of workflows and bioinformatic pipelines supporting primer evaluation, variant detection, taxonomic assignment and analyses of genetic diversity. The integration of curated reference databases, multi-marker strategies and advanced informatics has allowed for scalable, reproducible and high-resolution investigations of nematode diversity. Recent innovations in long-read sequencing and CRISPR-based enrichment, which may enable amplification-free, multi-locus profiling of nematode communities, are also highlighted. Collectively, these advances in molecular and genomic technologies - underpinned by reproducible informatic frameworks - are transforming the systematics, diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance of parasitic nematodes of animals.","Gasser, Robin B","Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Melbourne Veterinary School, Faculty of Science, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia.

Although radiation-induced DNA breaks eliminate most cells, a subset of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) evade death through massive genomic amplification, subsequently undergoing depolyploidization via a viral budding-like process to generate proliferative progeny. Critically, these PGCCs drive tumor repopulation and underpin therapeutic failure. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate PGCCs budding and the mechanisms by which they bypass the intrinsic safeguards against abnormal proliferation remain unclear. In this study, we dissected the life cycle of PGCCs in colorectal cancer post-radiation. Specifically, we used a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, functional genomics, and longitudinal models to map the dynamic transition from polyploid persistence to PGCCs budding. We reveal that S100A4-a key mediator of PGCCs repopulation-is significantly upregulated in post-radiotherapy PGCCs. S100A4 depletion significantly suppresses budding capacity by blunting viral budding-like proliferation, mechanistically achieved through suppression of IRF3-mediated interferon-I signaling, thereby alleviating ISG15/BST2-mediated suppression of budding. Further mechanistic studies revealed that S100A4 binds the RAGE receptor to facilitate this process. Pharmacological inhibition of RAGE phenocopied S100A4 depletion, impairing PGCCs budding and restoring radiation sensitivity. These results nominate the S100A4-ISG15 axis as a central regulator of radiotherapy resistance and suggest that stratifying patients by S100A4-ISG15 expression or the ""viral budding score"" could predict radiotherapy resistance. Additionally, targeting this axis may offer an opportunity to overcome adaptive persistence in colorectal cancer and possibly other cancer types.","Zhao, Ruyi; Song, Yanwei; Xie, Jianzhu; Sun, Haoran; Gong, Yanping; Hu, Binjie; Cheng, Jin; Deng, Zheng; Zhao, Yucui; Huang, Qian","Cancer Center, Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory for Pancreatic Diseases and Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.

40845583,The haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assembly of Spinibarbus caldwelli provides insights into environmental adaptability and disease resistance.,"Spinibarbus caldwelli is a cyprinid freshwater fish of significant economic and ecological value that is known for its strong environmental adaptability and disease resistance. As an allotetraploid species with a complex genome structure, the lack of a high-quality reference genome has long hindered in-depth studies on its evolutionary mechanisms and adaptive basis. In this study, we employed PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing in combination with Hi-C technology to generate a high-quality, haplotype-resolved chromosome-level reference genome of S. caldwelli. Two haplotypes (Haplotype 1 and Haplotype 2) were assembled, with total lengths of 1.76 Gb and 1.78 Gb respectively. Based on homologous chromosome alignment and genome collinearity analysis, the genome was partitioned into two subgenomes (A and B), confirming its allotetraploid origin. Further integrated gene family evolution and positive selection analyses revealed that genes within several key functional pathways, such as the Fanconi anemia pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and B-cell receptor signaling pathway, presented significant signals of expansion or positive selection. These pathways represented essential biological processes that support genomic stability and immune defense in S. caldwelli under complex hydrodynamic conditions and potential pathogenic stress. The results offer a valuable theoretical and data foundation for studies on genome stability, immune evolution, polyploid diversification, and molecular breeding in cyprinid fishes.","Wu, Yannian; Li, Yang; Cheng, Zhiqiang; Xu, Hao; Wang, Maoyuan; Ye, Xiaojun; Lai, Mingyong; Zhang, Dongling","Key Laboratory of Healthy Mariculture for the East China Sea, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jimei University, Xiamen, China.; Key Laboratory of Healthy Mariculture for the East China Sea, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Jimei University, Xiamen, China.

We present genome-wide data of 205 individuals from modern Georgia and 25 from Armenia, spanning the period from the Bronze Age (BA) to the ""Migration Period"" (c. 3500 BCE-700 CE). Our results reveal a persisting local gene pool that, during the Middle-Late BA, absorbed additional ancestry from Anatolia and the neighboring Eurasian Steppe. In subsequent periods, we document population growth and increasing genetic diversity, supported by a high rate of individual ancestry outliers, particularly in urban centers of eastern Georgia. Among 20 Medieval individuals with artificially deformed skulls, 15 were part of local mating networks and five derived ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, suggesting that cranial modification arrived with nomadic groups but became a locally adopted cultural practice.","Skourtanioti, Eirini; Jia, Xiaowen; Tavartkiladze, Nino; Bitadze, Liana; Shengelia, Ramaz; Tushabramishvili, Nikoloz; Aslanishvili, Vladimer; Gasparyan, Boris; Kandel, Andrew W; Naumann, David; Neumann, Gunnar U; Bianco, Raffaela Angelina; Mötsch, Angela; Prüfer, Kay; Lamnidis, Thiseas C; Traverso, Luca; Ghalichi, Ayshin; Ellingvåg, Sturla; Stockhammer, Philipp W; Krause, Johannes; Ringbauer, Harald","The Role of Culture in Early Expansions of Humans (ROCEEH), Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Tübingen, Germany.; Paleoanthropology, Institute for Archaeological Sciences, Department of Geosciences, Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.; Department of Archaeogenetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean (MHAAM), Leipzig, Germany.; Department of Archaeogenetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Anthropology Department, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.; Department of Archaeogenetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean (MHAAM), Leipzig, Germany; Institute for Pre- and Protohistoric Archaeology and Archaeology of the Roman Provinces, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.

40818455,RNA Pol II inhibition activates cell death independently from the loss of transcription.,"RNA Pol II-mediated transcription is essential for eukaryotic life. Although loss of transcription is thought to be universally lethal, the associated mechanisms promoting cell death are not yet known. Here, we show that death following the loss of RNA Pol II activity does not result from dysregulated gene expression. Instead, it occurs in response to loss of the hypophosphorylated form of Rbp1 (also called RNA Pol IIA). Loss of RNA Pol IIA exclusively activates apoptosis, and expression of a transcriptionally inactive version of Rpb1 rescues cell viability. Using functional genomics, we identify the mechanisms driving lethality following the loss of RNA Pol IIA, which we call the Pol II degradation-dependent apoptotic response (PDAR). Using the genetic dependencies of PDAR, we identify clinically used drugs that owe their lethality to a PDAR-dependent mechanism. Our findings unveil an apoptotic signaling response that contributes to the efficacy of a wide array of anti-cancer therapies.","Harper, Nicholas W; Birdsall, Gavin A; Honeywell, Megan E; Ward, Kelly M; Pai, Athma A; Lee, Michael J","Department of Systems Biology, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA; Program in Molecular Medicine and Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.

To achieve this, we developed wellDR-seq, a high-genomic-resolution, high-throughput method to simultaneously profile the genome and transcriptome of thousands of single cells. We profiled 33,646 single cells from 12 estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers and identified ancestral subclones in multiple patients that showed a luminal hormone-responsive lineage, indicating a potential cell of origin. In contrast to bulk studies, wellDR-seq enabled the study of subclone-level gene-dosage relationships, which showed near-linear correlations in large chromosomal segments and extensive variation at the single-gene level. We identified dosage-sensitive and dosage-insensitive genes, including many breast cancer genes as well as sporadic copy-number aberrations in non-cancer cells. Overall, these data reveal complex relationships between copy number and gene expression in single cells, improving our understanding of breast cancer progression.","Wang, Kaile; Ye, Rui; Bai, Shanshan; Xiao, Zhenna; Yang, Lei; Li, Jianzhuo; Tang, Chenling; Sei, Emi; Peng, Jinyu; Casasent, Anna K; Lin, Steven H; Nagi, Chandandeep; Thompson, Alastair M; Krishnamurthy, Savitri; Navin, Nicholas E","Department of Surgery, Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Systems Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Systems Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA; MD Anderson UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Bioinformatics, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

40782350,"Host genomic convergence, rather than gut microbiome convergence, underlies the convergent evolution of subterranean adaptation in mammals.","Subterranean mammals exhibit diverse traits for underground life, making them ideal models for studying molecular mechanisms of adaptation and convergence in extreme environments. To investigate these processes at both the genomic and gut microbiome levels, we assemble a chromosome-level genome of the Chinese bamboo rat (Rhizomys sinensis) and identify an expansion of the Hsp90 gene family, potentially associated with hypoxia adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis reveals gene expression changes related to tooth development and visual perception in the Chinese bamboo rat. Furthermore, we identify convergent genetic changes related to vision, hearing, immunity, and hypoxia among subterranean mammals, with widespread Krt9 pseudogenization potentially linked to long-term burrowing behavior. However, the gut microbiome shows no structural or functional convergence in subterranean mammals, being shaped by host phylogeny and gut morphology rather than habitat. These findings suggest that host genomic rather than gut microbiome convergence underlies convergent subterranean adaptation, offering multi-omics insights into subterranean adaptation.","Li, Kexin; Liu, Yixin; Zhang, Yehao; Fan, Zhenxin; Hu, Xiangxu; Lai, Xinlei; Wei, Fuwen; Hu, Yibo","State Key Laboratory of Animal Biodiversity Conservation and Integrated Pest Management, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; Key Laboratory of Bioresources and Ecoenvironment (Ministry of Education), College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.; State Key Laboratory of Animal Biodiversity Conservation and Integrated Pest Management, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.; State Key Laboratory of Animal Biodiversity Conservation and Integrated Pest Management, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Conservation Biology, College of Forestry, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang 330045, China.

We thereby explored the impact of CR in >300 cellular states and 11 brain regions. CR delayed expansion of inflammatory cell populations, preserved neural precursor cells, and broadly reduced the expression of aging-associated genes involved in cellular stress, senescence, inflammation, and DNA damage. CR restored the expression of region-specific genes linked to cognitive function, myelin maintenance, and circadian rhythm. In summary, we provide a high-resolution spatiotemporal map of the aging mouse brain's response to CR, detailing precise cellular and molecular mechanisms behind its neuroprotective effects.","Zhang, Zehao; Epstein, Alexander; Schaefer, Chloe; Abdulraouf, Abdulraouf; Jiang, Weirong; Zhou, Wei; Cao, Junyue","Laboratory of Single-Cell Genomics and Population Dynamics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA; The David Rockefeller Graduate Program in Bioscience, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.; The David Rockefeller Graduate Program in Bioscience, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.; Laboratory of Single-Cell Genomics and Population Dynamics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.; Laboratory of Single-Cell Genomics and Population Dynamics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA; The Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, New York, NY, USA.; Laboratory of Single-Cell Genomics and Population Dynamics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.

40913762,DDX3X mutation and Epstein-Barr virus cooperate to induce R-loop-dependent oncogenesis.,"RNA helicase DDX3X is generally implicated in inflammasome activation and anti-viral responses. We characterize the common features of scattered DDX3X mutations in lymphoid cancers using molecular dynamics simulation and crystallization, thereby demonstrating their crucial role in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic gene-driven oncogenic processes. The DDX3X mutation is significantly related to impaired stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/ interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7)/interferon (IFN)-α/β-mediated innate immunity, overexpression of EBV lytic gene BNLF2b, and increased formation of R-loops.

40780402,Whole Exome Sequencing-identified Germline Variants Underlie High Familial Risk and Early-onset Colorectal Cancer in Taiwan.,"Germline genetic factors influence the clinical features of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, these factors remain underexplored in Taiwan. This study aims to evaluate the pathogenicity of germline variants and investigate their associations with familial risk and early-onset CRC. Whole exome sequencing of 600 Taiwanese patients with CRC was analyzed, assessing variant pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Comparative analysis with 1492 controls identified candidate genes, and clinical features were correlated with genetic variants. We identified several novel candidate genes, including CCDC18 and CEP135. A total of 24 pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer genes were found in 5.2% of Taiwanese patients with CRC, with the highest prevalence observed in early-onset cases (8.2%). Notably, a novel stop-gain variant in POLD1 (p.Y594X) was detected in a 26-year-old patient, suggesting dysfunction of the polymerase catalytic domain.

Neonates with unexplained dysmorphic features or one or more congenital anomalies, unexplained dysfunction in one or more organ systems, or out of proportion clinical severity warrant genetic testing. Unless clinical features strongly suggest a specific chromosomal or single gene disorder, a broader genetic testing approach, ideally rapid exome or genome sequencing, is suggested.

40886665,Development and validation of AI-driven multi-omics language models for cancer genomics: A comprehensive review.,"The pervasive challenges in cancer management, ranging from accurate early diagnosis to effective personalised therapies and precise patient stratification, represent significant clinical unmet needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cancer research by offering unprecedented capabilities in analysing complex genomic datasets. AI has completely transformed omics research by simplifying the integration of multi-omics data, offering more profound insights into cancer heterogeneity, and enhancing predictive models for patient treatment responses. In the past decade, numerous studies have highlighted how AI has revolutionised omics research. AI models are instrumental in enhancing oncology by addressing these unmet needs through improved clinical trial matching, refined risk assessment, and precise treatment selection. They contribute to more personalised and effective cancer care by classifying cancer types and subtypes, identifying biomarkers, predicting drug responses, stratifying patients, and analysing tumour evolution and heterogeneity. This comprehensive review specifically focuses on the development and validation of AI-powered multi-omics language models for cancer genomics. We posit that the integration of diverse omics data types provides synergistic insights beyond single-omics approaches, which are critical for unravelling cancer heterogeneity and addressing the complex challenges within cancer genomics. The review highlights recent advances, current difficulties, and potential paths forward for these integrated AI approaches. We also detail the main elements of these models, such as their architectures, training plans, evaluation techniques, and data preprocessing. All things considered, multi-omics language models powered by AI hold immense promise for deriving biological insights from intricate cancer genomic data and converting them into actionable information for clinical settings.","Jha, Medha; Hasija, Yasha","Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University (DTU), Delhi 110042, India.

Applying this method to detect alternative splicing in neurons demonstrates improved accuracy and sensitivity compared to existing tools, notably identifying neuron subtypes. In tumor cells, spatial dissimilarity analysis reveals somatic variants that emerge during tumor progression, validated through whole-exome sequencing. These findings highlight how allele-specific genetic variants contribute to the subclone architecture of cancer cells, offering insights into cellular heterogeneity. Applied on a human cell atlas, we uncover numerous cases of allele-specific expression of genes in normal cells.

40902592,Robust and adaptive non-parametric tests for detecting general distributional shifts in gene expression.,"Differential expression analysis is crucial in genomics, yet most methods focus only on mean shifts. Variance shifts in gene expression-especially in cellular signaling and aging-are increasingly recognized as being biologically important. We present QRscore (quantile rank score), a general non-parametric framework that extends the Mann-Whitney test to detect both mean and variance shifts through model-informed weights derived from negative binomial (NB) and zero-inflated NB (ZINB) distributions. QRscore offers high statistical power with false discovery rate (FDR) control, surpassing existing methods in detecting both types of distributional changes. When applied to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), QRscore uncovers numerous genes with dispersion shifts that are missed by mean-shift analysis. In pseudo-bulked single-cell RNA-seq data from the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), QRscore further reveals cell-type-specific variance shifts across age groups that remain undetectable in bulk analyses. QRscore augments the genome bioinformatics toolkit by offering a powerful and flexible approach for differential expression analysis.","Zhou, Fanding; Aw, Alan J; Erdmann-Pham, Dan D; Fischer, Jonathan; Song, Yun S","Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA; Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.

40778314,PCLDA: An interpretable cell annotation tool for single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on simple statistical methods.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, yet accurate and consistent cell-type annotation remains a crucial challenge. Numerous automated tools exist, but their complex modeling assumptions can hinder reliability across varied datasets and protocols. We propose PCLDA, a pipeline composed of three modules: t-test-based gene screening, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), all built on simple statistical methods. An ablation study shows that each module in PCLDA contributes significantly to performance and robustness, with two novel enhancements in the second module yielding substantial gains. Despite these additions, the model retains its original assumptions, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art methods across 22 public scRNA-seq datasets and 35 distinct evaluation scenarios, PCLDA consistently achieves top-tier accuracy under both intra-dataset (cross-validation) and inter-dataset (cross-platform) conditions. Notably, when reference and query data are generated via different protocols, PCLDA remains stable and often outperforms more complex machine-learning approaches. Furthermore, PCLDA offers strong interpretability, attributed to the linear nature of its PCA and LDA modules. The final decision boundaries are linear combinations of the original gene expression values, directly reflecting the contribution of each gene to the classification. Top-weighted genes identified by PCLDA better capture biologically meaningful signals in enrichment analyses than those selected via marginal screening alone, offering deeper functional insights into cell-type specificity. In conclusion, our work underscores the utility of carefully enhanced simple statistics methods for single-cell annotation. PCLDA's simplicity, interpretability, and consistently high performance make it a practical, reliable alternative to more complex annotation pipelines.

Alongside the collection of this data, there is an increasing need for the development of modern computational tools leveraging this data for tasks including but not limited to antimicrobial resistance and gene annotation. Current deep learning architectures and tokenization techniques have been explored for the extraction of meaningful underlying information contained within this sequencing data. We aim to survey current and foundational literature surrounding the area of deep learning architectures and tokenization techniques in the field of genomics. Our survey of the literature outlines that significant work remains in developing efficient tokenization techniques that can capture or model underlying motifs within DNA sequences. While deep learning models have become more efficient, many current tokenization methods either reduce scalability through naive sequence representation, incorrectly model motifs or are borrowed directly from NLP tasks for use with biological sequences. Current and future model architectures should seek to implement and support more advanced, and biologically relevant, tokenization techniques to more effectively model the underlying information in biological sequencing data.","Testagrose, Conrad; Boucher, Christina","Department of Computer and Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,,2025,07,28,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40821715,10.1016/j.csbj.2025.07.038,40821715,0,,
40778317,Integrative machine learning approach for forecasting lung cancer chemosensitivity: From algorithm to cell line validation.,"Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment modality for patients with lung cancer; however, substantial inter-patient variability exists in responses to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, predicting individual responses is critical for optimizing treatment outcomes and improving patient prognosis. This study developed a model to predict chemotherapy response in lung cancer patients by integrating multi-omics and clinical data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, employing 45 machine learning algorithms. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were utilized to validate the model. The impact of key genes on chemotherapy response was assessed in cell lines. A model combining random forest and support vector machine algorithms exhibited superior performance in both the training and validation sets. Furthermore, patients in the sensitive group demonstrated longer overall survival compared to those in the resistant group. TMED4 and DYNLRB1 genes were identified as pivotal features in the model and exhibited higher expression levels in the chemotherapy-resistant group. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of gene expression enhanced the chemosensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents. This study successfully developed a high-performance machine learning model for predicting chemotherapy response in lung cancer and elucidated a strong correlation between TMED4 and DYNLRB1 gene expression and chemotherapy resistance. We further provide a user-friendly web server (available at https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/LC-DrugPortal/) to enable clinical utilization of our model, promoting personalized chemotherapy selection for lung cancer patients.","Chen, Jinghong; Yi, Yonglin; Yang, Chunqian; Ying, Haoxuan; Zhang, Jian; Lin, Anqi; Wei, Ting; Luo, Peng","Department of Oncology, Zhujiang Hospital, The Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University; Donghai County People's Hospital (Affiliated Kangda College of Nanjing Medical University), Lianyungang 222000, China.; Department of Oncology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, China.; School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,,2025,07,24,2025,08,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40778317,10.1016/j.csbj.2025.07.043,40778317,0,,

Discovering novel antifungal drugs is crucial for effective treatment. This study identifies and describes a native bacterial isolate, <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain IRMC27M2, with anti-<i>C. auris</i> activity. An integrated approach was used, including <i>16S rRNA</i> gene sequencing to identify the bacterial isolate, followed by whole-genome sequencing, antifungal analysis, cytotoxicity testing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and comparative genomics. The IRMC27M2 genome was sequenced using nanopore long-read sequencing and the resulting genome (3,87,328 bp) is phylogenetically related to <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> and <i>Bacillus velezensis</i>. Biosynthesis-related gene clusters (BGCs) were identified in the IRMC27M2 genome. Media optimisation protocols (FRC6 and REM3) were performed to enhance secondary metabolite production and the resulting ethyl acetate fractions were analysed by UV spectrophotometry and GC-MS. Antifungal analysis with metabolites from <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain IRMC27M2 significantly reduced cell size and induced crushed phenotypes in <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. auris</i>. Collapse of cell membranes and lysis of cells were observed. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 10 BGCs potentially involved in antifungal compound biosynthesis. The metabolites produced using FRC6 and REM3 protocols showed no cytotoxic effects. GC-MS analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction revealed a range of metabolites, with diosgenin being the most abundant. Manual and reverse verification confirmed the presence of genes linked to the methylerythritol phosphate biosynthesis pathway and confirmed the capability of IRMC27M2 for diosgenin production. In conclusion, the findings highlight the significant potential of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain IRMC27M2 as a biofactory for the production of diosgenin. This signifies promising future research for developing treatments against multidrug-resistant <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. auris</i> which are prioritised by the WHO.

40829558,DPANN archaea.,"Archaea are one of the two primary domains of life alongside Bacteria. Extant archaea play an important role in global nutrient cycles and comprise members that were crucial for the evolution of life on Earth including the origin of eukaryotic cells through a symbiotic integration of an archaeal and bacterial partner. Despite their importance in ecology and evolution, our knowledge of archaeal diversity and function remains limited in part because it has proven challenging to cultivate archaea in the laboratory. Over the last two decades, the use of novel cultivation-independent approaches such as metagenomics has not only led to the discovery of a vast diversity of previously unknown archaeal lineages but also provided a window into their genomic content, allowing researchers to make predictions about metabolic functions and lifestyles. For example, by combining genomics approaches with phylogenetic analyses (that is, the reconstruction of species trees) researchers have uncovered several phylum-level lineages of putative genome-reduced archaea referred to as the 'DPANN' archaea, whose members were shown to have limited metabolic capabilities, indicating their dependency on symbiotic partners. These findings are consistent with observations from cultivation-based studies that have succeeded in enriching some of these small-cell symbionts in co-cultures with their hosts. Although they were initially discovered in extreme environments, DPANN archaea have now been shown to be widespread across a variety of environments and may thus play an important role in not only host evolution but also ecology. Herein, we aim to highlight DPANN archaea by providing an overview of their diversity, genomic and metabolic features, unique cell biology and interactions, and evolutionary origins. We also underscore several fascinating topics that remain underexplored.","Huang, Wen-Cong; Spang, Anja","Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry, NIOZ, Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, 1790 AB Den Burg, The Netherlands; Department of Evolutionary and Population Biology, Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED), University of Amsterdam, 1090 GE Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

40829589,Pangenome biology and evolution in harmful algal-bloom-forming pelagophytes.,"In prokaryotes, lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a key mechanism leading to intraspecies variability in gene content and the phenomenon of pangenomes. In microbial eukaryotes, however, the extent to which LGT-driven pangenomes exist is unclear. Pelagophytes are ecologically important marine algae that include Aureococcus anophagefferens-a species notorious for causing harmful algal blooms. To investigate genome evolution across Pelagophyceae and within Ac. anophagefferens, we used long-read sequencing to produce high-quality genome assemblies for five strains of Ac. anophagefferens (52-54 megabase pairs [Mbp]), a telomere-to-telomere assembly for Pelagomonas calceolata (32 Mbp), and the first reference genome for Aureoumbra lagunensis (41 Mbp). Using comparative genomics and phylogenetics, we show remarkable strain-level genetic variation in Ac. anophagefferens, with a pangenome (23,356 orthogroups) that is 81.1% core and 18.9% accessory. Although gene content variation within Ac. anophagefferens does not appear to be largely driven by recent prokaryotic LGTs (2.6% of accessory orthogroups), 368 orthogroups were acquired from bacteria in a common ancestor of all analyzed strains and are not found in P. calceolata or Au. lagunensis. A total of 1,077 recent LGTs from prokaryotes and viruses were identified within Pelagophyceae overall, constituting 3.5%-4.0% of the orthogroups in each species. This includes genes likely contributing to the ecological success of pelagophytes globally and in long-lasting harmful blooms.","Sibbald, Shannon J; Lawton, Maggie; Maclean, Charlotte; Roger, Andrew J; Archibald, John M","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, 5850 College Street, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; Institute for Comparative Genomics, Dalhousie University, 5850 College Street, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.

40840167,Physical activity relates to carotid plaque vulnerability in older persons with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis.,"Recent evidence suggests that excessive physical activity may accelerate the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. However, data on carotid atherosclerosis remains scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the association between physical activity and changes in carotid atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, and the interaction between these two variables with the risk of first-ever stroke. This prospective study included 1330 stroke-free persons (mean age: 71.5 years) from the population-based Rotterdam Study with carotid atherosclerosis. Carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess intraplaque haemorrhage (IPH) and lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), both recognised as important vulnerable plaque components, with a follow-up MRI conducted approximately six years later in 699 participants. Physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire at baseline MRI. The association of physical activity with incident plaque components and the interaction between these two variables with the risk of stroke were analysed, adjusting for socioeconomic status and conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Higher volumes of total, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous physical activity were associated with an increased risk of incident IPH and LRNC, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.08 to 1.35 per 20 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours/week increase. Physical activity was further categorised using literature-based cut-offs, tertiles, quartiles, and quintiles, with the lowest group as the reference. The risk of incident IPH was significantly higher exclusively in the top quintiles of total, moderate-to-vigorous, and vigorous physical activity (adjusted OR range: 1.87-2.54, all P < 0.05), with thresholds of potential harm (99, 70, and 26 MET-hours/week, respectively) substantially exceeding current guideline recommendations for cardiovascular disease prevention (15, 15, and 7.5 MET-hours/week, respectively); similar patterns were also observed for LRNC. No association was found for moderate activity. The association between physical activity and first-ever stroke differed by the presence of vulnerable plaque components at baseline (P for interaction = 0.010 for total, 0.095 for moderate-to-vigorous), and physical activity inversely associated with stroke only in individuals without vulnerable plaque components (adjusted hazard ratio range: 0.69-0.71, all P < 0.05). In older individuals with pre-existing carotid atherosclerosis, the most physically active group may have a higher risk of developing vulnerable carotid plaques. Individuals with pre-existing vulnerable carotid plaques may lose the benefits of physical activity.

40839912,"Overcoming data management challenges in oncology research: Lessons from an NHS, industry, technology start-up and academic collaboration.","The integration of large-scale genomic and multimodal data is critical to advancing oncology research. However, challenges related to data storage, sharing, and governance hinder its effective use. We share experience from conducting a multi-site, cross-industry UK project utilising large-scale genomic data obtained from tissue and liquid biopsies from patients with cancer, to produce recommendations for enabling and optimising the use of multimodal data in oncology research. A collaborative approach involving NHS Trusts, industry, start-ups, and academic partners was adopted to develop a robust data management strategy. A data lake architecture was selected as the centralised repository to store and share diverse datasets securely. Key factors influencing the selection and implementation of this solution included data storage requirements, access control, ownership, and information governance. Processes for planning, deploying, and maintaining the data lake infrastructure were documented and evaluated. The data lake enabled secure, compliant, and federated storage of large-scale genomic and clinical data. Successful implementation required early engagement of stakeholders and the establishment of clear data governance frameworks. Lessons learned highlighted the importance of aligning technical solutions with governance, security, and accessibility requirements across diverse partners. Effective management of multimodal data in oncology requires early planning, multi-stakeholder engagement (among National Health Service [NHS] Trusts, industry, start-up collaborators, and academic institutions), and robust governance. The data lake model demonstrated a scalable and compliant approach to enabling secure, collaborative research using genomic data, providing a template for future initiatives in precision oncology.","Conway, Alicia-Marie; Concannon, Matthew; Brown, Steven; Hussain, Humera; Marland, April; Griffiths, Matthew; Plummer, Barney; Warrington, Kelly; Bridges, Claire; Lightning-Jones, Karen; Cook, Natalie","Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK; The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.

40850669,Overview and expansion of CEP85L-associated lissencephaly.,"Defective neuronal migration causes lissencephaly (LIS), a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with a smooth cerebral surface and abnormal cortical thickness. Variants in CEP85L are linked to posterior predominant LIS, but the phenotype and genotype are unclear. Three new unrelated cases of CEP85L-associated LIS are presented, including the first prenatal diagnosis and a mosaic variant. Clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic analyses were recorded. Data from 29 previously reported individuals was used in a comprehensive literature review. Human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms were used to annotate phenotypic features, and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines were used to evaluate variants. All postnatal individuals had variable NDD. Global developmental delay was observed in 71 % (22/31), speech or motor delay in 54 % (11/31 and 6/31, respectively), and intellectual disability in 74 % (23/31) of cases. Focused and generalized-onset seizures occurred in 90 % (28/31). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed predominantly posteriorly predominant LIS in all evaluated individuals, with 55 % (17/31) of cases also exhibiting subcortical band heterotopia (SBH). A total of 18 different CEP85L variants were identified among all individuals, all clustering in a highly conserved N-terminal region between amino acids 1 and 103. These included 10 missense mutations, five splice-site alterations, two start-loss variants, and one stop variant. Nine de novo variants, 10 mother-father variants, and 13 variants with unknown inheritance. Genotype-phenotype correlations in CEP85L-associated LIS show that stronger splice and germline variants often cause more severe symptoms than mosaic variants. To reduce confusion caused by alternative CEP85L transcripts, we recommend NM_001042475 for variant interpretation. These findings improve this disorder's genetic diagnostics and counseling framework.","Schumann, Isabell; Abou Jamra, Rami; Jauss, Robin-Tobias; Karnstedt, Maike; Specht, Ulrich; Zacher, Pia; Woermann, Friedrich; Yaron, Yuval; Popp, Bernt","Epilepsy Center Kleinwachau, Radeberg, Germany; LVR-Hospital Bonn, Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy II, Germany.; Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany; Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Center of Functional Genomics, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Epileptology (Krankenhaus Mara), Medical School, Bielefeld University, Epilepsy Center Bethel, Bielefeld, Germany.; Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany; Centre for Medical Genetics, Department of Medical Genetics, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.

The HER2DX ERBB2 messenger RNA (mRNA) assay, a clinically validated genomic test initially developed for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, quantitatively measures ERBB2 expression and may improve patient selection for T-chemo in AGC. In a retrospective cohort of 134 patients with AGC, including 58 who received T-chemo, we evaluated whether the HER2DX ERBB2 score defines more accurately HER2 status and correlates with treatment response and survival outcomes in HER2-positive AGC, compared with standard pathology-based methods. Our findings demonstrate that a high HER2DX ERBB2 score was significantly associated with improved progression-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.95, P = 0.012] and overall survival (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.81, P = 0.008). These results suggest that ERBB2 mRNA expression, as measured by HER2DX, may help refine selection for T-chemo and guide more personalized treatment strategies in HER2-positive AGC.","Pesántez, D; Brasó-Maristany, F; Pascual, T; Angelats, L; Indacochea, A; Cuatrecasas, M; López, S; Sanfeliu, E; Fernández-Esparrach, G; Notario, L; Méndez, I; Momblan, D; Candia, L; Macias, I; Prat, A; Sauri, T","Clínic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Translational Genomics and Targeted Therapies in Solid Tumors, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain; Clínic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain.; Translational Genomics and Targeted Therapies in Solid Tumors, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain; Reveal Genomics, Barcelona, Spain; Clínic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Clínic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain; Pathology Department, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Enfermedades Hepáticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Madrid, Spain.; Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Translational Genomics and Targeted Therapies in Solid Tumors, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain; Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Reveal Genomics, Barcelona, Spain; Clínic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain.

40889861,"Comparative genomics and phenotypes of Oenococcus alcoholitolerans and Oenococcus oeni, two sister species adapted to ethanol-rich environments.","From the genus Oenococcus, the most studied species is O. oeni due to its role in malolactic fermentation (MLF) during the winemaking process. In 2014, a new member of the genus -alongside O. kitaharae and O. sicerae- was discovered: O. alcoholitolerans. Whereas O. oeni is found in oenological matrixes, from grapes to wine, O. alcoholitolerans is found in cachaça residues and bioethanol fermentation. Though these ecological niches are different, they share the presence of high ethanol concentrations, which could be related to their evolutionary adaptation. This study provides the first sequenced and circularized genome of O. alcoholitolerans (UFRJ-M7), which was used for a comparative genomic analysis with the species O. oeni. In addition, the physiological traits of both species were compared regarding malolactic fermentation performance and survival in conditions of increasing ethanol and acid. The results showed great genetic differences in genes related to defence mechanisms, transcriptional factors, and some aspects of metabolism, such as sugar catabolism, purine/pyrimidine, coenzyme and vitamin biosynthesis. All these variations can be attributed to the specific adaptations of O. oeni and O. alcoholitolerans to their respective ecological niches. Notably, O. alcoholitolerans has not been detected in analyzed wine samples. This observation aligns with laboratory-based physiological tests, which demonstrated that the combined stress of ethanol and low pH prevented the survival of O. alcoholitolerans, despite its ability to carry out the MLF.","Balmaseda, Aitor; Lorentzen, Marc; Duthil, Lucie; Miot-Sertier, Cécile; Claisse, Olivier; Nielsen, Tue K; Hansen, Lars; Lucas, Patrick","Univ.

40889870,Genomics uncover resistant and virulent Klebsiella on foods: a potential risk to human health.,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a bacterium of public health importance due to its association with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its role as a major cause of both hospital- and community-acquired infections. While Klebsiella species have been detected in foods, our understanding of their diversity and the potential risks they pose from food is limited. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the Klebsiella species population and their contribution to the burden of AMR, virulence, and heavy metal tolerance from diverse food samples. We generated short-read sequence data for 570 Klebsiella isolates recovered from 361 food samples, including leafy greens, pork, prawns, chicken, salmon, and shellfish. Genome analysis showed that eleven unique Klebsiella species were present across food commodities, with K. pneumoniae being the most common (28.3 %); food-derived genomes were intermingled with publicly available Klebsiella genomes isolated from human clinical infections. We detected critical AMR genes, bla<sub>CTX-M-15</sub>, bla<sub>CTX-M-27</sub>, bla<sub>SHV-70</sub>, and bla<sub>DHA-1</sub>, in K. pneumoniae (n = 8) and K. quasipneumoniae (n = 6) from prawns. Additionally, we identified 46 virulent K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae isolates from domestic and imported food, including two hypervirulent K. pneumoniae isolates from domestic pork samples. Notably, a K. planticola isolate from salmon exhibited the hypermucoviscosity phenotype. AMR and virulence genes on plasmid contigs were widespread across different Klebsiella species, while chromosome-linked genes were mostly species-specific. These results highlight that food can harbour a range of Klebsiella species with resistance and virulence genes typically found in clinical settings, underscoring the need for monitoring foodborne Klebsiella as a potential risk to human health.","Zamudio, Roxana; Yap, Min; Bloomfield, Samuel J; Palau, Raphaëlle; Janecko, Nicol; Mather, Alison E","Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UQ, United Kingdom; Centre for Microbial Interactions, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UG, United Kingdom; University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom.

A broad host range of the bacteriophage vB_SaRS_FS19-1 was found, and the lysis rate of S. aureus was 84 % (42/50). Electron microscopic and genomic DNA analyses suggested that phage vB_SaRS_FS19-1 is a recently discovered absence of lysogeny genes phage, classified under the genus Kayvirus within the family Herelleviridae.

40816690,Evolutionary conservation and Immunoregulatory function of LOXL3 gene in lamprey.,"Lysyl oxidase (LOX) family enzymes play a pivotal role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and tissue homeostasis, and have evolved diverse functions in vertebrate immunity and metabolism. However, the evolutionary trajectory of these multifunctional roles-particularly in jawless vertebrates-remains obscure. Here, we investigate LOXL3 in the lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri), a jawless vertebrate that retains ancestral features of early vertebrate evolution. Through comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstruction, we identify Lr.LOXL3 as an ortholog within the vertebrate LOXL3 clade, preserving the conserved catalytic motifs shared across the LOX/LOXL1-4 family. Spatial expression profiling reveals predominant localization of Lr.LOXL3 in the endostyle and liver, with dynamic regulation upon immune challenge (PHA/LPS). Functional interrogation via siRNA knockdown and transcriptomic analysis uncovers a dual role for Lr.LOXL3 in coordinating both innate and adaptive immune responses, alongside reprogramming glycolipid metabolism to maintain immune-metabolic homeostasis. Notably, Lr.LOXL3 exhibits a transitional evolutionary state-retaining ancestral ECM-remodeling capacity while acquiring regulatory features absent in other agnathans but diversified among higher vertebrate paralogues. This intermediate architecture underscores the value of the lamprey as a model for investigating the origins of LOX gene diversification and the emergence of immune-metabolic integration across vertebrate evolution.","Pang, Ya; Yan, Zihao; Gao, Yicheng; Li, Ding; Zhao, Liang; Ma, Guoxiu; Zhao, Yuetong; Du, Mingwei; Sun, Feng; Han, Yinglun","College of Life Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Lamprey Research Center, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, 116081, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Seafood Deep Processing, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian, 116034, China.

40882709,Genome-transcriptome co-analysis identifies members and molecular characteristics of the TRAF gene family in Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii).,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), as key signal transducers, play a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, current research on the systematic identification of the TRAF family and its functional role in Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) is relatively unexplored. In this study, TRAF family members were first identified in A. baerii using comparative genomics and transcriptome analyses. To further determine the TRAF sequences of A. baerii, the open reading frame (ORF) sequences of the Abtraf1, Abtraf5, Abtraf6, and Abtraf7 were cloned. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these Abtraf exhibit high sequence similarity and evolutionary conservation across teleost species. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis revealed high Abtraf expression in the whole pre-larvae stage and immune-related tissues such as the head kidney, gill, and spleen. Induction of Abtraf gene expression was observed upon stimulation with Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas hydrophila in vivo. In this study, head kidney leukocytes (HKLs) were isolated and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), or poly(I:C), all of which induced Abtraf expression, with significant upregulation occurring early post-treatment. Notably, Abtraf5 responded predominantly to bacterial components (LPS/PGN), whereas Abtraf7 was specifically poly(I:C)-responsive. These findings help clarify the molecular roles of Abtraf and provide a basis for further functional research on TRAF in teleosts.","Dai, Shaotong; Zhu, Hao; Chen, Defang; Chen, Yinqiu; Zhou, Jiawen; Jin, Zhiqian; Long, Wei; Zhang, Xin; Li, Zhiqiong","Aquaculture Department, College of Animal Science & Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.

40857784,Independent validation of the VISAGE enhanced tool for age prediction in Koreans and analysis of platform transition.,"Age prediction based on DNA methylation is emerging as a pivotal topic in forensic genetics, providing crucial information for criminal investigations. The Europe-based VISible Attributes Through GEnomics (VISAGE) Consortium recently reported a series of age prediction models by analyzing blood, buccal cells, and bone DNA using the Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) method, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of less than 4 years. To explore population-specific differences, we replicated the VISAGE MPS-based analysis using 300 blood and 150 buccal cell DNA samples from Korean individuals. Since the VISAGE models' equations are not publicly available, we constructed new models using multiple linear regression at the same CpG sites. Despite differences in the ranking of age-correlated CpG markers, our newly developed blood age model for Koreans exhibited a comparable MAE (3.4 years) to the VISAGE blood model (MAE of 3.2 years), whereas our buccal cell model demonstrated a slightly higher MAE (4.3 years) compared to the VISAGE buccal cell model (MAE of 3.7 years). Furthermore, to facilitate broader application across platforms, we developed additional models using the SBE method and conducted a comparative analysis of methylation levels with those obtained by the MPS method. This comparison revealed significant inter-platform differences (p-value <0.05) in methylation levels across all CpG sites included in VISAGE blood and buccal cell models. To address this issue, we developed platform-independent models by calibrating methylation levels using 11 control DNAs with varying methylation ratios (0 %-100 %). Although the calibrated data still exhibited statistically significant differences between platforms, the platform-independent model for blood achieved high prediction accuracy, with an MAE of 3.6 years. However, the buccal cell model displayed lower accuracy and still showed inter-platform variations, indicating that the calibration method is affected differently by CpG sites. Additionally, we optimized age prediction models for Koreans by employing various regression methods to the Korean MPS dataset. Both blood and buccal cell models achieved high age prediction accuracies, with MAEs below 3.4 years and 4.2 years, respectively.

40821117,Unveiling the regulatory potential of the non-coding genome: Insights from the human genome project to precision medicine.,"The Human Genome Project marked a milestone in scientific exploration, unraveling the genetic blueprint of humanity. However, expectations of direct gene-disease associations gave way to realizing the complexity of genetic interactions, especially in polygenic diseases. This review explores the legacy of the HGP and subsequent advancements in genomic technologies, particularly next-generation sequencing, which have enabled more profound insights into the non-coding genome's role in gene regulation. While initially dismissed as ""junk"" DNA, non-coding regions are now officially approved as critical gene expression and genome organization regulators. Through integrative genomics approaches and advanced computational methods, researchers have unveiled the intricate network of enhancers, promoters, and chromatin modifications orchestrating gene expression. High-throughput sequencing techniques and functional assays have identified non-coding variants associated with numerous diseases, challenging the conventional focus on coding sequences in genomic studies. By elucidating the regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression, researchers can advance precision medicine approaches and develop novel diagnostic tools. As genomic research continues to evolve, a vast landscape is waiting to be explored, promising transformative insights into human health and disease. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the non-coding genome's role in gene regulation and its implications for understanding complex diseases and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.","Ruffo, Paola; Traynor, Bryan J; Conforti, Francesca Luisa","Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.; Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA.; Medical Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy.",Genes & diseases,Genes Dis,,2025,04,22,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40821117,10.1016/j.gendis.2025.101652,40821117,0,,

40893834,Pathogenic variation underlying rare diseases in an Arab population: Implications for screening programs.,"Genetic variation underlying rare diseases in Arab populations is poorly understood limiting effective carrier screening for recessive disorders, which are prevalent because of high consanguineous rates. Using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines, we curated pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 1333 Arab Emirati families (346 internal cohort and 987 from the literature). We also analyzed P/LP variants in 1194 Emirati exomes, calculated allele frequencies, and estimated carrier rates for the associated recessive conditions. Among the 1333 families, 1060 had 701 variants meeting the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology criteria for pathogenicity, with 52% and 30% being absent from the Genome Aggregation Database and ClinVar databases, respectively. Independently, we determined the frequency of P/LP variants in 1194 Emirati exomes, as well as cumulative gene-disease carrier rates. The <i>CYP21A2</i> gene (HGNC:2600) showed the highest carrier rate (10.6%) followed by <i>HBB</i> (HGNC:4827) (9.6%), <i>MEFV</i> (HGNC:6998) (5.9%), and <i>ABCA4</i> (HGNC:34) (4.3%). Using a provisional gene list for carrier screening, based on our analysis, we estimated an at-risk couples rate of 4% to 21%, which varies across different screening panels recommended in other populations.

40915439,Structure and dynamics dictate the functional destiny of genomic DNA across multiple organisms.,"DNA is a dynamic molecule composed of numerous genic and regulatory elements that orchestrate cellular functions. Traditional methods often fail to provide accurate functional genome annotations because they do not effectively account for sequence variability within and across different organisms. To address this, we conducted an extensive genomic physical fingerprinting of ~4.6 million genomic elements. Utilizing multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulation-derived parameters over higher nucleotide steps, we uncovered critical details about the physicochemical profiles of key DNA elements, including Coding Sequences, Promoters, Gene boundaries, Exon-Intron boundaries, Start Codons, and Stop Codons across the four diverse eukaryotic kingdoms. This exploration marks a significant advancement in functional genomics and opens new avenues for genome annotation, enhancing our understanding of eukaryotic genome complexity. We identified characteristic biophysical signals associated with key genomic sites across all 11 organisms studied. Our results demonstrate that closely related organisms exhibit similar patterns, underscoring the universality of our features. Furthermore, an investigation in human Enhancers and 5'/3' UTR boundaries support this novel structural and energetic framework to annotate genomic elements with unprecedented accuracy. Lastly, sequence to structure and dynamics to function was an established axiom in proteomics. Our results demonstrate that this is true for nucleic acids as well.","Sharma, Dinesh; Aslam, Danish; Mittal, Aditya; Jayaram, B","Supercomputing Facility for Bioinformatics & Computational Biology (SCFBio) & Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, 110016, India; Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, 110016, India.

40835496,Recommendations for management and future investigation of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease: Findings from the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) working group.,"Psychosis is frequently observed in patients with neurodegenerative disease and may precede onset of cognitive symptoms. Additionally, the presence of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease is often associated with adverse effects including increased progression of cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, increased caregiver burden, and increased rates of placement in long-term care. Moreover, existing pharmacological treatments, which consist principally of off-label antipsychotic medications, may be associated with increased risk of harm, making management of symptoms challenging. We review recent advances in the field of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease, including advances in clinical criteria, biomarkers (neuroimaging, pathology, and genomic and epigenomics), and treatments. Under the direction of the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA), a task force comprised of experts in the field of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease was convened. An in-person meeting was organized in September 2024, coincident with the annual IPA Congress. The task force undertook a review of the literature in the areas of clinical care, biomarkers, and treatment, from which key recommendations for the management and future investigation of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease were derived. It was concluded that psychosis in neurodegenerative disease has a characteristic phenomenology that despite sharing some features with schizophrenia spectrum psychotic disorders, may differ in other clinically meaningful aspects. Etiopathogenesis based on biomarker, genomic, and treatment studies may differ to some extent among neurodegenerative diseases. There is emerging evidence supporting the use of prescriptive non-pharmacological (WHELD intervention) and novel pharmacological (pimavanserin, muscarinic agonists) approaches in the treatment of psychosis in neurodegenerative disease. Future directions include the need for the implementation of evidence-based nonpharmacological treatments consistent with the aims of precision medicine, further investigation into novel pharmacological agents, mapping specific psychotic symptoms to specific biomarkers, and further exploration of the link between psychosis in neurodegenerative disease and other late-life psychoses.","Namasivayam, Andrew A; Fischer, Corinne E; Abler, Victor; Creese, Byron; Gastiazoro, Maria Paula; Hermida, Adriana P; Ikeda, Manabu; Ismail, Zahinoor; Jeste, Dilip V; McDermid, Joanne; Mills, Kathryn; Pathak, Sanjeev; Peschin, Susan; Pot, Anne Margriet; Mintzer, Jacobo; Sano, Mary; Cummings, Jeffrey; Ballard, Clive","Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Social Determinants of Health Network, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Instituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral (ISAL), Facultad de Bioquímica y Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Santa Fe, Argentina.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Research, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.

40792032,Multi-omics whole-genome characterization of the copy number landscape of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive disease with limited therapeutic options. While genome profiling has benefitted clinical decision-making in many cancer types, PDAC remains among the most lethal solid cancers and has relatively few clinically actionable molecular targets. Using a multi-omics approach, we integrate whole-genome and transcriptome datasets along with proteomics and clinical metadata to identify copy-altered regions with significant impact on expression at the whole-genome scale. This approach identified <i>SMURF1, ARPC1A, ZSCAN25,</i> and <i>BRI3</i> as focally amplified and over-expressed genes located on chr7q21/22 with expression negatively correlated with patient survival. We extrapolate these results into a pan-cancer analysis to demonstrate that the association between <i>SMURF1</i> amplification versus expression is strongest in PDAC among 23 other cancer types. Taken together, these data provide a detailed overview of the copy number landscape in PDAC while highlighting chr7q21/22 amplification as a recurrent somatic event impacting both gene expression and patient survival.","Topham, James T; Karasinska, Joanna M; Metcalfe, Andrew; Ali, Hassan A; Kalloger, Steve E; Kevorkova, Maya; Titmuss, Emma; Negri, Gian Luca; Spencer, Sandra E; Jang, Gun Ho; O'Kane, Grainne M; Moore, Richard A; Mungall, Andrew J; Loree, Jonathan M; Notta, Faiyaz; Wilson, Julie M; Bathe, Oliver F; Tang, Patricia A; Goodwin, Rachel; Morin, Gregg B; Knox, Jennifer J; Gallinger, Steven; Laskin, Janessa; Marra, Marco A; Jones, Steven J M; Renouf, Daniel J; Schaeffer, David F","Pancreas Centre BC, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Division of Medical Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medical Genetics and Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Division of Anatomic Pathology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UBC, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Departments of Surgery and Oncology, Cummings School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",iScience,iScience,,2025,07,22,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40792032,10.1016/j.isci.2025.113176,40792032,0,,
40894868,A 3D genome compendium of breast cancer progression.,"During cancer development and progression massive alterations in gene expression are observed. Gene regulation occurs within the context of the 3D genome. However, the impact of disease progression on 3D genome organization remains poorly understood. Using breast cancer as a model, we have profiled the 3D genome throughout the natural course of the disease; from development to progression. Uniquely, we analyzed tumors from the same patients, enabling us to gauge the extent of changes that happen upon metastasis. Our results show that the organization of the genome at the level of topologically associating domains (TADs) and compartments upon tumorigenesis and metastasis, is remarkably stable. However, in pleural metastases, representing heavily pretreated progressive disease, the 3D genome is massively affected, and highly heterogeneous between patients, both on the compartment and TAD level. Our data reveal that disease progression in breast cancer is associated with a progressive unraveling of the 3D genome.","van den Brand, Teun; Collier, Maria Donaldson; Flach, Koen D; Gregoricchio, Sebastian; Mayayo-Peralta, Isabel; Dauyey, Zhanna; Schuurman, Karianne; Teunissen, Hans; Zwart, Wilbert; de Wit, Elzo","Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute & Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.",iScience,iScience,,2025,08,05,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894868,10.1016/j.isci.2025.113268,40894868,0,0,NONE

However, the structural and deleterious variant burden has not been investigated in the foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>). Integrating comparative genomics, pangenomics, population genetics, and quantitative genetics, we identified 6,713 gene gains and 2,802 losses during domestication, affecting flowering time and developmental processes. Population genetics of 333 wild and cultivated accessions revealed 25.76% and 40.40% reductions in structural and deleterious variant burdens in cultivars, potentially reflecting a dramatic loss of genetic diversity of the wild progenitor. Quantitative genetics detected genetic association of yield traits, and essential roles of deleterious and structural variants in the formation of yield traits. In general, this study highlights significant impacts of structural and deleterious variants on yield traits and provides valuable guidelines for molecular breeding of foxtail millet.","Du, Mengrui; Zhang, Fan; Wang, Xu; Zhang, Tianhao; Yang, Xuanwen; Liu, Yuting; Zhang, Yingchun; Hou, Ting; Hang, Guizhou; Fang, Xinyue; Li, Jiacui; Xue, Hui; Zhou, Yongfeng; Wang, Jiagang","National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, China.; Special Orphan Crops Research Center of the Loess Plateau, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, College of Agriculture, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu 030801, China.",iScience,iScience,,2025,08,06,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894897,10.1016/j.isci.2025.113295,40894897,0,0,NONE
40914606,Multiomics approach to evaluating personalized biomarkers of allergen immunotherapy.,"Recent advancements in genomics and ""omic"" technologies have ushered in a transformative era referred to as personalized or precision medicine. This innovative approach considers the unique genetic profiles of individuals, along with a range of variability factors, to devise tailored disease treatments and prevention strategies that cater to the distinct needs of each patient. Although the terms personalized medicine and precision medicine are frequently utilized interchangeably, it is essential to delineate the subtle distinctions between them. Personalized medicine concentrates on bespoke treatments and prevention strategies that are meticulously tailored for each individual. Conversely, precision medicine utilizes advanced gene sequencing and comprehensive data analytics to formulate specific treatments and prevention strategies for defined groups of individuals based on genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors rather than focusing exclusively on individual patients. Therefore, precision medicine constitutes an extension of traditional personalized care, improving the accuracy of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy estimations for each patient through the application of sophisticated molecular diagnostics and advanced imaging techniques enabled by recent technological innovations. The shift from personalized to precision medicine has gained considerable traction, particularly in the wake of the 2015 US Precision Medicine Initiative, which has further stimulated advancements in this domain. This review will explore multiomics approaches that have facilitated the evaluation of personalized biomarkers associated with allergen immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of allergic diseases. By leveraging these innovative methodologies, we aspire to cultivate more effective and individualized patient care, ultimately enhancing health outcomes for individuals with allergies.","Shamji, Mohamed H; Fulton, William T; Animashaun, Ibrahim; Palmer, Elizabeth; Baerenfaller, Katja; Sokolowska, Milena; Barber, Domingo; Huffaker, Michelle; Baloh, Carolyn; Pfaar, Oliver; Ollert, Markus; Klimek, Ludger; Rabin, Ronald L; Tripathi, Anubha; Togias, Alkis; Vieths, Stefan; Shreffler, Wayne G; Layhadi, Janice A","Immune Tolerance Network, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, Calif.; Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, University of Zurich, Davos, Switzerland.; Immune Tolerance Network, Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason, Seattle, Wash; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass; Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Section of Rhinology and Allergy, Philipps-Universität Marburg, University Hospital Marburg, Marburg, Germany.; Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Frankland and Kay Allergy Centre, UK NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, United Kingdom.

Current treatments often fall short due to issues like treatment resistance, side effects, and variable patient adherence. This study investigates shared molecular mechanisms and actionable therapeutic targets across these disorders. We integrated genetic data from over 500,000 individuals in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and FinnGen biobank. A multi-step framework combined protein quantitative trait loci analysis, Mendelian randomization for causal inference, cross-disorder meta-analyses, and colocalization to prioritize protein targets. Genetic correlations confirmed pleiotropic links among the three disorders. Cross-disorder analyses identified ITIH1 and TIMP4 as consistently associated proteins. Colocalization revealed four high-confidence targets: IGLON5 (synaptic plasticity, OR = 0.69), PTK7 (apoptosis regulation, OR = 0.71), LIMA1 (lipid metabolism, OR = 0.52), and HBEGF (neurotrophic signaling, OR = 1.21). These proteins converge on glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and stress-response pathways. Molecular docking confirmed druggable potential, with binding energies below -7.0 kcal/mol. IGLON5, PTK7, LIMA1, and HBEGF emerge as mechanistically grounded targets for transdiagnostic therapies. HBEGF's bidirectional effects highlight its potential for personalized treatment strategies.

40848898,Genome-wide characterization and adaptive evolution of favorable gibberellin 2-oxidase alleles contributing to wheat agronomic traits.,"Gibberellins are essential phytohormones that regulate plant growth and development. Gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) deactivate bioactive gibberellin isoforms and many GA2ox genes have been validated as key regulators of agronomic traits in model plants and crops. However, there are few studies on GA2ox genes in wheat, one of the most important staple crops. This study aims to identify favorable alleles of wheat GA2ox genes (TaGA2oxs) and assess their application in wheat improvement. We developed an efficient pipeline that integrates population genomics, transgene, transcriptome and evolutionary analyses to systemically dissect genetic effects of TaGA2ox variations on agronomic traits. We identified 40 TaGA2oxs by genome-wide in silico cloning, defined 25 C19-type and 15 C20-type members based on sequence similarity and specified TaGA2ox family expansion by genomic polyploidization, duplication and translocation events. Functional TaGA2oxs were predicted by spatiotemporal expression assays, genetic meta-analysis and genome microsynteny-based phylogeny. We retrieved 52 major haplotypes at 19 TaGA2ox loci based on genome resequencing data for representative wheat cultivars and developed diagnostic molecular markers. In addition to previously-validated favorable haplotypes Rht12b and Rht24b that reduce plant height and have no yield penalty, eight new favorable haplotypes of TaGA2oxs were identified by marker-trait association analysis. Among them, TaGA2ox8-B1-1_hap1, TaGA2ox8-B1-2_hap1 and TaGA2ox8-B1-3_hap1 formed a tandem duplicate gene cluster associated with reduced plant height and increased grain yield. TaGA2ox8-B1-2 as proof of concept was functionally validated to modulate major agronomic traits by transgene assays; its downstream genes and effect on gibberellin homeostasis were also identified by transcriptome, enzyme activity and hormone quantitative analyses. We further traced the origin, spread and distribution of favorable haplotypes to clarify their evolutionary history and application prospects. These findings not only provide valuable genetic resources and molecular tools for wheat improvement but also broaden genetic insight into gibberellin-mediated wheat morphogenesis, acclimation and yield formation.","Bian, Yingjie; Dong, Jiayu; Li, Lingli; Xu, Dengan; Tian, Xiuling; Dong, Yan; Zeng, Jianqi; Cao, Qiang; Dong, Yachao; Xie, Lina; Liu, Bingyan; Qu, Kejia; Chao, Yuheng; Che, Rui; Liu, Jindong; Zhang, Yong; Xia, Xianchun; Sun, Daojie; Lu, Fei; He, Zhonghu; Cao, Shuanghe","Crop Research Institute, Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, 490 Huanghe Road, Yinchuan 750002 Ningxia, China.; College of Agronomy, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao 266109, China.; State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.; State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Resources and Breeding/National Wheat Improvement Center, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.; State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Resources and Breeding/National Wheat Improvement Center, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China; College of Agronomy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100 Shaanxi, China.; State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Resources and Breeding/National Wheat Improvement Center, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.

40912654,GreenCells: A comprehensive resource for single-cell analysis of plant lncRNAs.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. With the advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, it is now possible to investigate lncRNA expression and function at single-cell resolution. Although several plant single-cell transcriptome databases have been established, they predominantly focus on protein-coding genes while largely overlooking lncRNAs. To bridge this gap, we developed GreenCells (http://greencells.liu-lab.com/), a comprehensive database specifically designed to explore plant lncRNAs at the single-cell level. By integrating scRNA-seq data from eight plant species, GreenCells has identified 2,177 lncRNA marker genes and 68,869 protein-coding marker genes across diverse cell types. The database also features cell type-specific co-expression networks that reveal the regulatory potential of lncRNAs, many of which function as hub genes. For example, co-expression network analysis suggests that lncCOBRA5 may be involved in transmembrane processes. In addition, by comparing bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles, we identified a set of lncRNAs uniquely expressed in specific cell types that are undetectable in root bulk RNA-seq data. We also observed a strong correlation between tissue-specific and cell type-specific expression patterns of lncRNAs. Overall, GreenCells provides detailed annotations, high-quality visualizations, advanced search functions, and practical analytical tools. It offers a valuable platform for investigating the regulation and expression of plant lncRNAs at single-cell resolution, thereby contributing a new resource to plant functional genomics research.","Wu, Changxiong; Liu, Jiazhi; Li, Yan; Yang, Wenjing; Wang, Jie; Liu, Changning","CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Yunnan Key Laboratory of Crop Wild Relatives Omics, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650223, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; Germplasm Bank of Wild Species & Yunnan Key Laboratory of Crop Wild Relatives Omics, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan 650201, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Yunnan Key Laboratory of Crop Wild Relatives Omics, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650223, China.; School of Life Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China; CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Yunnan Key Laboratory of Crop Wild Relatives Omics, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650223, China.

While model organisms and mutagenesis screens are helpful, they can be labor-intensive. This study demonstrates a streamlined gene cloning approach using the human TERE1 gene and the pUAST vector system for expression in Drosophila S2 cells. The pUAST vector was employed to clone the TERE1 gene and insert it into S2 cells, allowing co-transfection with multiple constructs for co-expression of up to four proteins. This provided a stable and selectable platform. The cloning of TERE1 in PcDNA3.1 and pUAST vectors confirmed the expression of TERE1 protein alongside EGFP. The expressed TERE1 protein in Drosophila melanogaster (D.m) Schneider recombinants resembled the normal Drosophila HEIX1 protein, which is critical in the larval-to-adult transformation as proved by western blot. The pUAST system proved effective for TERE1 gene cloning and the simultaneous expression of multiple proteins. This simplified method presents an efficient alternative to traditional mutagenesis screens, facilitating gene function studies and aiding the identification of disease-related genes.","Dragh, Maytham A; Al-Allak, Zainab S; Allami, Zainab Z","Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Misan, Amarah, Iraq.; Department of Applied Pathological Analysis, College of Science, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq.; Department of Medical Physics, College of Science, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq.

40854651,Biodegradation of plastics and pesticides by soil bacteria in Bangladesh: Insights into antibiotic resistance and potential therapeutic targets.,"Soil bacteria exhibit varying degrees of tolerance to different concentrations of pesticides and plastics, and some possess the ability to degrade them, which is crucial for bioremediation. However, the multidrug-resistant properties of these bacteria pose challenges for their potential applications. Hence, this study aims to separate and characterize plastics and pesticide-degrading bacteria fromnon-contaminated and contaminated sites in Bangladesh and evaluate their antibiotic-resistant patterns to identify safety issues and discover promising therapeutic targets for combating multidrug-resistant infections. In the current study, a total of 90 soil samples were collected from different agricultural and dumped sites of Bangladesh, and bacterial isolates were screened for pesticides and plastics-degrading capabilities. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the potential isolates were evaluated using 16 different antibiotics. Biochemical, molecular, and genomic analyses were conducted to characterize the bacteria and identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Our study screened out 122 plastic and 60 pesticide-tolerant bacterial isolates. Among them, 3 pesticide and 3 plastic-degrading isolates were found to be more promising and identified as Acinetobacter baumannii with pesticide-degrading capabilities from non-contaminated sites, and Klebsiella pneumoniae with plastic-degrading capabilities from contaminated sites. Antibiotic sensitivity test exhibited that most of the isolates were resistance to commonly used antimicrobials. The genomics and proteomics analysis uncovered the efflux pump-related genes responsible for the resistant mechanism and highlighted the involvement of genes that respond to antibiotics and transmembrane transport activities. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the conservation of 2 common resistance genes adeF and gyrA, across diverse multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, targeting conserved genes adeF and gyrA, to disrupt resistance mechanisms and combat persistent and clinically significant multidrug-resistant pathogens could be a promising strategy for developing combination therapies in medical science.","Ahmed, Azrin; Mahmud, Shahin; Tania Khatun, Mst; Firoz Ali, Md; Rony Akter, Mst; Mohiuddin, A K M","Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail-1902, Bangladesh.; Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail-1902, Bangladesh.

40854665,Targeting Streptococcus pyogenes atpF protein for multi-epitope vaccine development: a genomics-driven immunoinformatics strategy.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, a medium-priority pathogen on the WHO's 2024 Bacterial Pathogen Priority List, is a major cause of infectious disease-related mortality. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance, coupled with the absence of a licensed vaccine due to the pathogen's genetic diversity and autoimmune concerns, underscores the need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study employs reverse vaccinology and subtractive proteomics to design a multi-epitope vaccine targeting atpF, a conserved extracellular protein essential for ATP synthesis. The atpF protein was identified based on its high antigenicity and functional importance in S. pyogenes. Three vaccine constructs (SM1, SM2, and SM3) were designed by integrating antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes with immune-modulating adjuvants and linkers. Physicochemical and immunological assessments confirmed their stability, solubility, and antigenicity. Molecular modeling identified SM1 as the most promising candidate, demonstrating superior immune receptor binding affinity and flexible epitope interactions, facilitating effective antibody recognition. In silico immune simulations further demonstrated SM1's potential to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses, while codon optimization confirmed efficient expression in E. coli.

40848895,Assembly of a high-quality reference genome and characterization of a chemical-mutagenized library of an elite soybean cultivar Tianlong 1.,"Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a globally vital crop for oil production and food security. High-quality genomic resources are instrumental for both functional genomics and breeding. Here, we report a near-complete, high-quality genome assembly of the elite cultivar Tianlong 1 (TL1), featuring fully resolved telomeres and centromeres, as well as a gap-free assembly of 14 of its 20 chromosomes. On the basis of the genome assembly, we generate an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population comprising 2,555 M<sub>7</sub> plants. Whole-genome re-sequencing of 288 EMS mutants uncovers 1,163,869 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 542,709 insertions/deletions (InDels), achieving 91.89% coverage of predicted protein-coding genes. Phenotypic screening demonstrates robust genotype-phenotype associations, with two nonsynonymous mutants displaying pronounced defects in seed and leaf development. Collectively, the chromosome-scale TL1 genome assembly and the extensively characterized mutant population establish valuable resources for functional genomics and precision breeding in soybean and related legume species.","Sheng, Yinghua; Huang, Yicheng; Jin, Zilun; Wang, Xuyan; Liu, Chenghui; Zhang, Jingwen; Zhou, Zhipeng; Ma, Chuang; Zhang, Jianwei; Chen, Min","State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement, School of Life Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan 475004, China.; Sanya Institute of Henan University, Sanya, Hainan 572025, China; State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Adaptation and Improvement, School of Life Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng, Henan 475004, China.; College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, China.

40915600,Deciphering the genetic regulation of flowering time in rapeseed for early-maturation breeding.,"Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait with a profound effect on the productivity and adaptability of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Strategically advancing flowering time can reduce the risk of yield losses due to extreme climatic conditions and facilitate the cultivation of subsequent crops on the same land, thereby enhancing overall agricultural efficiency. In this review, we synthesize current information on flowering time regulation in rapeseed through an integrated analysis of its genetic, hormonal, and environmental dimensions, emphasizing their crosstalk and implications for yield. We consolidate multi-omics evidence from population genetics, functional genomics, and systems biology to create a haplotype-based framework that overcomes the trade-off between flowering time and yield, providing support for the precision breeding of early-maturing cultivars. The insights presented here could inform future research on flowering time regulation and guide strategies for increasing rapeseed productivity.","Zhang, Minghao; Chang, Wei; Hu, Ruicheng; Ruan, Yuxuan; Li, Xiaodong; Fan, Yonghai; Meng, Boyu; Li, Shengting; Qian, Mingchao; Chen, Yuling; Mao, Yuanyi; Song, Daifei; Yang, Haikun; Niu, Luxiang; Cao, Guangyuan; Deng, Zhixia; Qin, Zhixuan; Wang, Hui; Lu, Kun","College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Beibei, Chongqing 400715, China; Jinhua Academy of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University, Jinhua, Zhejiang 321015, China.

40915267,"Mechanisms of cypermethrin degradation and remediation by Rhodococcus sp. H-3: Insights from comparative genomics, hydrolase CymE1 secretory expression, and bacterial community analysis.","Cypermethrin, a common pyrethroid insecticide, raises significant ecological concerns due to its widespread use. In this study, a highly efficient cypermethrin-degrading strain, Rhodococcus sp. H-3, was isolated. The strain was capable of degrading 30 mg/L cypermethrin at the rate of 83.48 % within 7 days and it could hydrolyze cypermethrin into 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and permethric acid (DCVA). A novel cypermethrin degradation gene, cymE1, was identified in strain H-3 through genome analysis, and its highest level of amino acid sequence similarity observed was 33.50 % in the Swiss-Prot database. The functional strain, SCK6-E, which could secrete CymE1, was successfully constructed by using double-exchange strategies. Strain SCK6-E could be applied for the removal of cypermethrin residues from tea plant leaves with a removal rate of 57.83 % within 2 h. Furthermore, strain H-3 demonstrated the capability to remediate cypermethrin-contaminated soil, exhibiting a degradation rate of 65.80 % over 10 days. The results of the 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing indicated that strain H-3 was conducive to the restoration of the diversity and richness of the bacterial community in the soil. This study provides novel strain and gene resources for researching the degradation mechanism of pyrethroids, and offers valuable insights for developing effective pesticide residue remediation strategies.","Zhao, Guoqiang; Chen, Wenjing; Zhang, Rongrong; Zhang, Rui; Jiang, Bo; Hou, Ruyan; Huang, Xing","College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210095, PR China.

40803577,Proteogenomic profiling predicts outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"Cholangiocarcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, and its molecular characteristics and biomarkers and not yet fully understood. Here we performed comprehensive proteogenomic analyses to investigate the molecular landscape of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCA). To identify potential biomarkers, prespecified exploratory analyses were conducted within the STAMP trial-a randomized phase 2 trial of adjuvant capecitabine or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GemCis) for patients with resected EH-CCA. Among 101 patients in the intention-to-treat population, 89 were included in the biomarker analysis (45 treated with GemCis, 44 with capecitabine). Surgical specimens were assessed by whole-exome sequencing and proteomics analyses. We performed correlative prognostic and predictive biomarker analyses for disease-free survival (DFS). Somatic mutations were most frequently detected in TP53 (63%), SMAD4 (20%), and KRAS (18%). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present in 10 patients (11%), microsatellite instability in one patient (1%), and actionable alterations, according to ESCAT classification, in 13 patients (15%). PIK3CA and FBXW7 mutations were significantly associated with poor DFS, and 11q13.3 amplification with favorable DFS. Some genomic alterations-including 8q24.21, 3q26.1, and 4p16.3 amplifications, 8p23.1 deletion, and HRD-showed significant interactions with the adjuvant treatment regimen, favoring GemCis. To integrate the impacts of these potentially predictive multiomic biomarkers, we developed a machine-learning prediction model to calculate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), and categorize patients into three groups: CATE-highest (favoring GemCis), middle (no predicted difference), and lowest (favoring capecitabine). The model showed significant interaction with adjuvant treatment, and was significantly associated with DFS. Here we identified several prognostic and predictive biomarkers that may be useful for guiding adjuvant chemotherapy selection in resected EH-CCA. Further validation is required. NCT03079427 IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Here we performed comprehensive proteogenomic analyses within a prospective randomized trial of patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EH-CCA). The findings highlighted specific genomic and proteomic alterations that were associated with differential benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. The integration of multiomics data into a machine learning model provides a practical framework for stratifying patients and guiding treatment decisions, which may inform future clinical trials and biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies.","Jeong, Hyehyun; Oh, Ji-Hye; Ahn, Hee-Sung; Ryoo, Baek-Yeol; Kim, Kyu-Pyo; Jeong, Jae Ho; Park, Inkeun; Hwang, Dae Wook; Lee, Jae Hoon; Song, Ki Byung; Lee, Woohyung; Kim, Ki-Hun; Moon, Deog-Bog; Song, Gi Won; Jung, Dong-Hwan; Hong, Seung-Mo; Park, Chae Won; Baek, In-Pyo; Cho, You Sook; Kim, Kyunggon; Sung, Chang Ohk; Yoo, Changhoon","AMC Sciences Inc., Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea; Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.; AMC Sciences Inc., Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.; Bioinformatics Core Laboratorys, Convergence Medicine Research Center, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea; Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.

40907670,Prospective whole genome sequencing to aid the identification and control of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus transmissions in a neonatal ICU.,"Conventional surveillance methods may miss healthcare-associated pathogen transmission, particularly for common, drug-susceptible organisms. It is unclear if prospective genomic analyses can help identify otherwise silent transmission events and inform prevention efforts. We sequenced methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) surveillance and clinical isolates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of an academic hospital between February 2022 and March 2024. Insights gleaned from genomic-epidemiologic analyses were used to control a large MSSA cluster and to calibrate infection control measures thereafter. There were 2352 babies admitted during the 26-month study period, of whom 318 became colonized or infected with MSSA. Monthly MSSA incidence rates were largely stable throughout this period, but whole genome sequencing demonstrated 16 MSSA clusters (range 2-19 babies/cluster). Sequencing data integrated with epidemiologic analyses informed escalating infection control measures to control a sustained cluster of 19 babies infected with MSSA ST30 (including increased hand hygiene monitoring, enhanced environmental and equipment cleaning, contact precautions, decolonization of MSSA carriers), a subsequent decision against further intensification (foregoing screening all staff members for MSSA carriage), and the subsequent liberalization of some interventions (dropping contact precautions for lower risk babies). While intensified infection control measures controlled the primary ST30 cluster, low-level transmission events (range 2-8 babies) were detected throughout the study period despite those interventions. Integrating prospective genomic and epidemiologic analyses of healthcare-associated pathogens can help identify unrecognized transmission clusters and inform and calibrate infection control response measures. Prospective genotyping of surveillance and clinical methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates in a neonatal intensive care unit over a 26-month period identified multiple MSSA clusters that were otherwise unappreciated and helped to both catalyze and calibrate infection control measures.","Baker, Meghan A; Klompas, Michael; Blaeser, Elizabeth Mermel; Rhee, Chanu; Abdulhayoglu, Elisa; Cadogan, Julie; Flanigan, Elizabeth; Pearson, Zach; Taffner, Samantha; Winkler, Marisa; Boire, Nicholas; Worley, Jay; Brigl, Manfred; Bry, Lynn; Pecora, Nicole","Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA, USA; Infection Prevention and Control, Department of Quality and Safety, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Massachusetts Host-Microbiome Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

40803551,DNA Topoisomerase II Mutations in Cancer: Structural Impact and Drug Response in High-grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma.,"Topoisomerases are essential enzymes that resolve DNA topological stress during replication and transcription. In mammalian cells, the two isoforms, TOP2A and TOP2B, differ in expression profiles and functions. TOP2A is a key regulator of cell division, mainly expressed in rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, and is therefore the primary target of several chemotherapeutic molecules. In contrast, TOP2B is ubiquitously expressed in both dividing and non-dividing cells and is not directly implicated in tumorigenesis. Despite their functional differences, the high homology of the two isoforms contributes to unwanted off-target effects of TOP2-directed therapies, sometimes leading to secondary cancer. Both isoforms can harbor naturally occurring or cancer-associated point mutations, which could confer altered sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy agents. Using data from cancer genomic databases, we analyzed hotspot mutations of both isoforms found in human tumors and conducted a molecular analysis based on structural and functional data. We identified TOP2 variants in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, a malignancy frequently treated with TOP2-targeting agents, such as doxorubicin or etoposide. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of modeling somatic mutations to assess enzyme conformation and therapeutic response. Additionally, this review provides insights that underline the potential value of including TOP2A and TOP2B in companion diagnostic gene panels used in personalized oncology, notably in cancers where TOP2-directed agents are part of the standard therapy.","Mazzoleni, Viola; Boichard, Amélie; Lamour, Valérie","Université de Strasbourg, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut national de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), UMR 7104-UMR-S 1258, F-67400 Illkirch, France; Department of Integrated Structural Biology, IGBMC, Illkirch, France.; Université de Strasbourg, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut national de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), UMR 7104-UMR-S 1258, F-67400 Illkirch, France; Department of Integrated Structural Biology, IGBMC, Illkirch, France; Laboratoire de Biochimie et de Biologie Moléculaire, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg F-67200 Strasbourg, France.

40895267,Association of TGF-β1 with periodontitis patients in north Indian population.,"Periodontitis is a complex disease caused by environmental and genetic factors. The course of periodontal destruction is influenced by local, ecological, and, predominantly, by genetic factors. Therefore, early detection of the disease through genomics and its course of destruction can be altered through genetic engineering, which can be a major breakthrough in the eradication of periodontitis. The purpose of this study is to find the genetic association of TGF-β1 gene polymorphisms in causing periodontitis in the North Indian population. A total of 364 subjects were selected in the present study, and they were divided into two groups, viz. Healthy (Group A) and Periodontitis (Group B), with 182 subjects in each. The detailed case history was recorded, buccal swab samples were collected and stored in the sterile medium at 4 °C. Correlation studies on gene polymorphism with the disease occurrence were carried out by estimating allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and chi-square test (GenAlex package), and linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis (SHEsis). The gene TGF-β1 showed a high rate of polymorphism in the north Indian population. The TGF-β1 gene showed polymorphism in the studied SNP sites. Among them, -29C/T and -788 C/T could differentiate the healthy and generalized periodontitis group; however, the localized periodontitis group could not be differentiated with any of the SNP loci.

40822515,"The role of multi-omics in biomarker discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring of tissue repair and regeneration processes.","In the last two decades, technological interventions have played a significant role in transforming healthcare with timely diagnosis and novel therapeutic interventions. Advanced technologies such as next-generation sequencing, NMR, mass spectrometry, and non-invasive imaging modalities have made it possible to study biological molecules, cellular processes, and molecular pathways in different diseases. The ""omics revolution"" is another addition that emerged as a powerful tool in elucidating molecular and cellular processes in diseases. Given the profoundly complex nature of tissue repair, it is important to employ the advanced multi-omics technique to elucidate the cellular, molecular, and inflammatory events in damaged tissues. As proven in various other diseases, these integrative omics can provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the biology of tissue repair and regeneration. Proteomics and transcriptomics, in particular, have been widely used for the identification and validation of potential biomarkers such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which play a key role in the process of tissue repair and regeneration. Metabolomics, such as NMR and spectroscopies, have also shown potential in tracking energy metabolism and oxidative stress during regeneration. This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest multi-omics techniques and technologies that provide valuable insights into the complex processes of tissue repair and highlight the possibilities of early diagnosis, biomarker identification, and novel therapeutic interventions for tissue repair and regeneration. Combining data and key findings from multiple omics layers, such as metabolomics, transcriptomics, and genomics, may provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that have been implicated in tissue repair and regeneration. This may lead to the identification and validation of robust biomarkers and the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes in patients with chronic and non-healing wounds. This article reviews the application of multi-omics technologies in tissue repair and regeneration, highlighting how the integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics reveals molecular mechanisms of wound healing. By combining these diverse omics approaches, the findings provide critical insights into novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and personalized treatment strategies.

40865426,Multi-omics approaches provide insights into adaptation to low salinity of intertidal clams.,"Climate change is reshaping the population distribution of intertidal organisms, with extreme weather inducing salinity fluctuations that challenge intertidal bivalves. In this study, we employed comparative genomics and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying low-salinity adaptation in the razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta). We compiled and analyzed genomic data from 19 molluscan species, classified as either euryhaline or stenohaline based on their salinity tolerance. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that partial Venerida clams may have been evolved into adaptation to low salinity environments at 86.45 Mya (million year ago), or earlier. A total of 440 genes in S. constricta genome were detected to be under positive selection through within-species comparison. Furthermore, we identified sixty-nine lipid metabolism-associated orthologous groups (OGs), including four specially expanded gene families in five intertidal bivalves. Additionally, we constructed twenty-seven transcriptomic libraries from gill, mantle and digestive gland tissues of S. constricta, revealing the species employs complex molecular mechanisms in response to low-salinity stress. Twenty-eight positive selected genes exhibited significant differential expression in razor clam transcriptomic data. By integrating genomic and transcriptomic data, we identified candidate genes involved in CDP-choline, CDP-ethanolamine pathways that enhance phospholipid synthesis in S. constricta, potentially representing an adaptive mechanism to low-salinity environments. Notably, we found the lack of Cav2 member of caveolin family in euryhaline clams, which involved in Caveolae formation promoted by phospholipid.

40848949,Comparative and phylogenomic analysis of Chlamydia pneumoniae reveals unique carbohydrate active enzyme family (GT5) among respiratory isolates.,"Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligatory intracellular pathogen found in humans and animals. Understanding the genomic diversity is crucial for unravelling its pathogenic mechanisms and transmission dynamics. In this study, 14 complete genomes of C. pneumoniae strains were compared for functional diversity analysis. The koala isolate LPCoLN appears as a phylogenetically distinct, showing the fewest accessory genes and the highest incorporation of unique or absent genes among the strains analyzed. Functional annotation indicates that certain metabolic pathways between the LPCoLN and the human respiratory strain AR39 were the same, which is most likely due to phage-associated elements present in AR39. The presence of the GT5 CAZyme family is significantly associated with strains of respiratory origin, suggesting a potential role in respiratory adaptation and pathogenic strategies, including tissue colonization, immune evasion, and niche-specific persistence. The strong association between GT5 CAZymes and respiratory-origin strains highlights their potential as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.","Jayachandiran, Susanthika; Suresh, Roja; Dhamodharan, Ramasamy","Mahatma Gandhi Medical Advanced Research Institute (MGMARI), Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University), Pondicherry 607402, India.; Mahatma Gandhi Medical Advanced Research Institute (MGMARI), Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University), Pondicherry 607402, India.

40812439,Within-host novel envZ mutation in Salmonella Enteritidis: Implications for virulence and antibiotic resistance.,"Within-host adaptation for Salmonella pulmonary infection is poorly studied. In this work, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) strains sequentially isolated from a patient with chronic pulmonary infections. Notably, isolates from blood, lung and pleural effusion showed variations in virulence and antibiotic resistance. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and comparative genomics identified an envZ mutation in the pleural effusion isolate, characterized by a novel 15-bp deletion in the transmembrane1 region. Construction of the envZ mutant and in vitro analyses demonstrated that this envZ mutation was associated with reduced growth rates, diminished biofilm formation and decreased survival in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Additionally, the mutation also resulted in increased antibiotic resistance, lower resistance to phagocytosis in RAW264.7 cells, and decreased adherence to bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that EnvZ evolution within Enterobacteriaceae was genus specific. In conclusion, our investigation identified a novel mutation site in envZ and demonstrated that it was involved in the adaptation of Salmonella during pulmonary infection.","Yan, Dongmei; Zhang, Lingyu; Zhang, Qisi; Tang, Qinfang; Wang, Yungang","Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital 6 of Nantong University, Yancheng Third People's Hospital, Yancheng, China.

Some similarities between Claviceps and Ustilaginoidea genera have been found, but according to recent genomic sequence comparison research, they have different sequences. U. virens secretes mycotoxins, which make the infected grains unfavorable for human consumption. The transcriptomic analysis and genome sequencing of U. virens showed 52,554,142 clean reads assembled into 36,496 transcripts, representing 18,534 unigenes. U. virens also contains the UvNLP protein as an NLP-specific NPP1 domain that belongs to a MAMPs class protein that acts as an elicitor for defence responses in resistant plants. Unique proteins, UvCGBP1, UvPRO1, and UvBI-1, are associated with the virulence, growth, and sporulation of U. virens. Several host QTLs-qFsr1, qFsr2, qFsr4, qFsr8, qFsr10, qFsr11 and qFsr12 have been validated in diverse background (IR28, Tequing NILs, MR183-2), and are crucial for resistance breeding. The genetic diversity of U. virens was measured using molecular markers, including RAPD, AFLP, SSR, ISSR, and, more recently, SNPs. The genetic diversity of U. virens isolates was higher among the isolates than in the geographical population. This review integrates advances in molecular biology, genomics, and host-pathogen interactions to inform sustainable management strategies. Further research is needed in early detection, chlamydospore germination, targeted fungicides, and resistant hybrid rice development.","Masurkar, Prahlad; Meher, Jhumishree; Thapa, Sukram; Singh, R K; Bag, M K; Gautam, Vedant; Maurya, Shivam","Department of Mycology and Plant Pathology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, 221005, India.; Department of Mycology and Plant Pathology, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, 221005, India.

40846079,Application of artificial intelligence in microbial drug discovery: Unlocking new frontiers in biotechnology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing antimicrobial drug discovery by delivering major improvements in precision, innovation, and efficiency for combating bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Traditional approaches to developing treatments for microbial infections are often hampered by high costs, lengthy timelines, and frequent failures. Modern AI technologies, particularly deep learning, machine learning, computational biology, and big data analytics, provide robust solutions to these challenges by analyzing large-scale biological datasets to predict molecular interactions, identify promising treatment candidates, and expedite both preclinical and clinical development. Innovative techniques such as generative adversarial networks for novel compound discovery, reinforcement learning for optimizing antimicrobial candidates, and natural language processing for extracting knowledge from biomedical literature are now vital to infectious disease research. These approaches facilitate early toxicity prediction, microbial target identification, virtual screening, and the development of more individualized therapies. Notwithstanding these advances, challenges remain, including inconsistent data quality, limited interpretability, and unresolved ethical or legal concerns. This review examines recent advancements in AI applications for microbial drug discovery, with a focus on de novo molecular design, ligand- and structure-based screening, and AI-enabled biomarker identification. Remaining application barriers and promising future directions in AI-driven antimicrobial drug development are also elucidated. Collectively, these innovations are poised to accelerate the discovery of new therapies, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes in the fight against infectious diseases.","Mulat, Mulugeta; Banicod, Riza Jane S; Tabassum, Nazia; Javaid, Aqib; Kim, Tae-Hee; Kim, Young-Mog; Khan, Fazlurrahman","Department of Biotechnology, School of Bioscience and Technology, College of Natural Sciences, Wollo University, Dessie, Ethiopia.

40784486,Genomic and transcriptomic landscape of Epstein-Barr virus-positive inflammatory follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: a multi-center study.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive inflammatory follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (EBV+ IFDCS) is a rare indolent malignant neoplasm, which occurs almost exclusively in the liver or spleen and may arise from a common EBV-infected mesenchymal cell that differentiates along the follicular or fibroblastic dendritic cell pathway. Despite its rarity, it presents a pressing need for an improved understanding of its genetic underpinnings and potential treatment strategies for recurrent or disseminated cases. To address this, we conducted comprehensive whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq) analyses on 31 and 6 cases of EBV+ IFDCS, respectively, collected from multiple centers in China. We also compared the genetic features of EBV+ IFDCS with those of other EBV-associated malignancies. Our analyses revealed a relatively high somatic mutation rate and widespread copy number variations affecting the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I/II in EBV+ IFDCS. Integrated mutational profiling identified key signaling pathways involved in epigenetic regulation, NF-κB signaling, RTK/RAS/PI(3)K, and the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, we identified several frequently altered genes that could serve as potential therapeutic targets in EBV+ IFDCS. Transcriptomic analysis unveiled significant upregulation of pathways related to virus infection, immune responses, and multiple immune checkpoint genes in EBV+ IFDCS. Comparative analysis demonstrated clear genetic distinctions between EBV+ IFDCS and other EBV-associated tumors. In conclusion, our study provides the comprehensive insight into the unique genomic and transcriptomic landscape of EBV+ IFDCS. We have identified multiple genetic alterations that likely contribute to the development and progression of this malignancy. Our results suggest that targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors may hold promise as potential therapeutic approaches for patients with recurrent or disseminated EBV+ IFDCS.","Li, Yan; Weng, Ze-Lin; Fei, Han-Xiao; Li, Hai-Feng; Liu, Yi-Na; Zhang, Le-le; Zhang, Qiong; Weng, Xin; Wang, Yuan-Yuan; Huang, Wen-Yong; Cao, Zhi-Xing; Yang, Kai-Yan; Chen, Xi-Liang; Gao, Jie; Yang, Wen-Sheng; Liu, Fang; Yong, Juan-Juan; Yun, Jing-Ping; Zhang, Hua; Huang, Yu-Hua","Department of Pathology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Shenzhen, P.

Although the core structural motif recognized by CRBN has been characterized, it does not fully explain substrate specificity. To explore the role of residues adjacent to this core motif, we constructed a comprehensive ZF reporter library of 9,097 reporters derived from 1,655 human ZF proteins and conducted a library-on-library screen with 29 glutarimide analogs to identify compounds that collectively degrade 38 ZF reporters. Cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures of ZFs in complex with CRBN revealed the importance of interactions beyond the core ZF degron. We used systematic mutagenesis of ZFs and CRBN to identify modes of neosubstrate recruitment requiring distinct amino acids. Finally, we found subtle chemical variations in glutarimide analogs that alter target scope and selectivity, thus providing a roadmap for their rational design.","Słabicki, Mikołaj; Park, Jiho; Nowak, Radosław P; Roy Burman, Shourya S; Pellman, Jesse; Zou, Charles; Razumkov, Hlib; Carreiro, Jeannie; Rastogi, Simran; Goldstein, Anna; Nagiec, Marek M; Donovan, Katherine A; Che, Jianwei; Hunkeler, Moritz; Geng, Qixiang; Hsu, Chi-Lin; Lakshminarayan, Megha; Shu, Chelsea; Zon, Rebecca L; Kozicka, Zuzanna; Park, Paul M C; Tsai, Jonathan M; Yoon, Hojong; Jones, Lyn H; Sperling, Adam S; Gray, Nathanael S; Fischer, Eric S; Ebert, Benjamin L","Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, ChEM-H, Stanford Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Chemistry, Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

40845822,Genomics in pre-registration nurse education: A narrative review.,"To identify and synthesise research on the development of nurse genomics education. It is becoming increasingly recognised that all nurses require an understanding of genomics. Nurse education must equip nurses with genomic literacy. This review explores the development and provision of genomics across international pre-registration curricula to highlight areas of importance and gaps. Narrative review. Following systematic searches in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, CINAHL, the British Nursing Database, PubMed and Maternity & Infant Care, qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods studies, systematic reviews, literature reviews, commentaries, editorials and reports from 2002, were included. Titles and abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers. Data were extracted on key concepts in the literature including approaches to teaching, links to practice and assessment, using a pre-defined tool but flexibly including inductive categories. Findings were thematically analysed and synthesised using a narrative review approach to provide a summary and critical discussion of the literature. 315 results were screened and 65 texts were reviewed. The largest number of papers were published in 2011 (n = 12). Most papers were published in North America (n = 47). Five themes relating to pre-registration genomics nursing education were created and explored. These were: Approaches to integration, Pedagogical approaches, Application to practice, Approaches to assessment and Approaches to evaluating education. Further guidance is needed for faculty on the effective integration of genomics, teaching and evaluation. Further research into the effectiveness of teaching strategies could contribute to standardised guidance.","Coulson, Jodie; Anderson, Helen; Adamson, Joy","Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK.

Nutrigenomics can be conceptualized as integrating molecular-level genomics and nutrition at the intersection of genomics, diet, and health. Specific nutrients affect our body's homeostatic regulation and metabolic pathways, and any dysregulation leads to the progression of diet-related diseases. Nutrigenetics elucidates the primary contributing factor regarding the dietary and genetic variations that cause such a profound effect. The results of nutrigenomics are derived from research on nutritional intervention strategies that, in the end, prevent diet-related diseases. Dietary assessment and planning accuracy can be enhanced through biomarkers and precise nutrition. Multidisciplinary attributes are necessary for the successful implementation of nutrigenomics. In contrast to first-generation transgenic crops, second-generation transgenics prioritize improved product quality.

40814354,Introduction to correlation networks: Interdisciplinary approaches beyond thresholding.,"Many empirical networks originate from correlational data, arising in domains as diverse as psychology, neuroscience, genomics, microbiology, finance, and climate science. Specialized algorithms and theory have been developed in different application domains for working with such networks, as well as in statistics, network science, and computer science, often with limited communication between practitioners in different fields. This leaves significant room for cross-pollination across disciplines. A central challenge is that it is not always clear how to best transform correlation matrix data into networks for the application at hand, and probably the most widespread method, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value to create either unweighted or weighted networks, suffers from multiple problems. In this article, we review various methods of constructing and analyzing correlation networks, ranging from thresholding and its improvements to weighted networks, regularization, dynamic correlation networks, threshold-free approaches, comparison with null models, and more. Finally, we propose and discuss recommended practices and a variety of key open questions currently confronting this field.","Masuda, Naoki; Boyd, Zachary M; Garlaschelli, Diego; Mucha, Peter J","Department of Mathematics, Brigham Young University, USA.; Department of Mathematics, State University of New York at Buffalo, USA.; Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leiden University, The Netherlands.; Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, State University of New York at Buffalo, USA.; Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, USA.; IMT School of Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy.",Physics reports,Phys Rep,,2025,06,30,2025,09,14,R01 DK125860_DK_NIDDK NIH HHS_United States; R01 GM148973_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40814354,10.1016/j.physrep.2025.06.002,40814354,0,,
40848829,Integrative Mendelian randomization analysis to identify causal plasma proteins and therapeutic targets for delirium.,"This study aims to identify potentially causal circulating proteins and novel drug targets for delirium using a Mendelian randomization (MR)-based analytical framework and various bioinformatics and genomics methods. Large-scale two-sample MR was employed to estimate the effects of thousands of plasma proteins on delirium. Additional analysis included Bayesian Colocalization, Steiger filtering, protein-altering variant assessment, and mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were conducted to identify potential therapeutic targets for delirium. Several plasma proteins were identified that show significant causal effects on delirium. Bayesian Colocalization confirmed that these proteins share a common genetic architecture with delirium-associated loci. Steiger filtering analysis validated the direction of causality. Assessment of protein-altering variants and eQTL-pQTL mapping provided further evidence supporting the MR findings. PPI networks and pathway enrichment analysis revealed involvement in key biological processes and pathways related to brain function and neuroinflammation. Several proteins were identified as potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for prevention and treatment of delirium. This study identifies several plasma proteins that have a significant causal relationship with delirium, suggesting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our comprehensive analysis using MR, Colocalization, and other bioinformatics approaches strengthens the evidence for these associations. The findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying delirium and highlight new targets for intervention, which could lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies for this condition.","Hao, Ruijinlin; Su, Ningwei; Fang, Yin; Li, Chaofang; Li, Yunfan; Cheng, Hao; Ding, Zhengnian","Pain Management Clinic, Changzhou Maternal And Child Health Care Hospital, Changzhou 213000, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.

40893341,"Exploring the relationships between Early Childhood Adversity, Social Cognition, and Aggression in a South African Study of People Living with Schizophrenia.","People living with schizophrenia (PLS) are at increased risk of being both victims and perpetrators of violence. Recent research suggests that social cognitive impairments may contribute to heightened aggression in schizophrenia. Childhood trauma, a well-established risk factor for both schizophrenia and aggression, is also linked to more severe cognitive deficits in PLS. Few studies have explored the relationships between childhood trauma, social cognition, and aggression in large sample sizes, particularly in low- and middle-income settings, where varying socioeconomic factors and exposure to violence may influence these associations. In this study, a subsample of participants (PLS = 585; controls = 882) from the <i>Genomics of Schizophrenia in the South African Xhosa People</i> study completed The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Penn Emotion Identification Test (ER), Life History of Aggression Questionnaire (LHA), and Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Group differences in CTQ, ER, LHA, and selected demographic and clinical factors were assessed using <i>t</i>-tests and chi-square tests. Multivariable linear regressions were employed to test for associations among CTQ, ER, and LHA. We found that PLS had significantly higher childhood trauma and lifetime aggression scores and poorer emotion recognition performance than controls. Higher childhood trauma was associated with higher lifetime aggression and worse emotion recognition performance. However, emotion recognition performance was not associated with lifetime aggression. In this setting, childhood trauma predicts lifetime aggression and poorer emotion recognition, but there is no evidence that emotion recognition ability is related to aggression.","van der Walt, K; Wootton, O; Rokicki, J; Vaskinn, A; Jonker, D; Campbell, M; Susser, E; Haukvik, U K; Gur, R C; Stein, D J; Friestad, C","Child and Adolescent Health Unit, Department of Paediatric and Child Health, University of Cape Town, South Africa.; University College of Norwegian Correctional Services, Lillestrøm, Norway.; Centre for Research and Education in Forensic Psychiatry, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; SAMRC Unit on Risk & Resilience in Mental Disorders, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Global Initiative for Neuropsychiatric Genetics Education in Research, Harvard T.H.

40834682,ATP2B1 variants associated with generalized epilepsy without neurodevelopmental disorders and the underlying mechanism.,"The ATP2B1 gene encodes the plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 1 (PMCA1), which is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays an essential role in intracellular calcium homeostasis, potentially affecting neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Previous studies have identified ATP2B1 variants in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the significance of ATP2B1 variants in epilepsy remains unknown. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the cohorts of patients with epilepsy without acquired etiologies. To define the gene-disease association, we reviewed previously reported variants of ATP2B1 and analyzed the damaging effects of the variants, genotype-phenotype correlation, and spatial-temporal expression pattern. ATP2B1 variants were identified in five individuals affected by generalized epilepsy or genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus from two unrelated families. The identified ATP2B1 variants included one de novo heterozygous missense variant (c.2920A>G/p.Ile974Val) and one co-segregated heterozygous missense variant (c.76G>A/p.Asp26Asn). The de novo variant was absent in any public population database and was evaluated as likely pathogenic according to the criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The co-segregated variant had an extremely low minor allele frequency (MAF = 7.955×10<sup>-6</sup>) in gnomAD. Computational modelling analysis suggested that the two variants led to impairment in protein stability. All of the patients had favourable outcomes without neurodevelopmental disorders. Further analysis revealed that neurodevelopmental disorders-associated variants were either biallelic variants or monoallelic truncation/missense variants, characterized by significant alterations in hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobicity, along with extremely high AlphaMissense scores; while epilepsy-associated variants were missense variants with relatively little damage, resulting in no changes in hydrogen bonding or hydrophobicity. Notably, missense variants located in the functional domain with severe damaging effect were more likely to manifest as neurodevelopmental disorders comorbid with epilepsy. Additionally, ATP2B1 exhibits relatively low baseline expression at early development stages but significantly increases in later stages, with particularly high expression in the striatum, which is consistent with the generalized epilepsy phenotype observed in this study, and explains that severe damage variants were associated with early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas milder damage variants were associated with epilepsy. ATP2B1 is a potential candidate gene for generalized epilepsy. Genetic dependent stage (GDS), gene tissue-specific expression and genotype-phenotype correlation contribute to the explanation of phenotypic heterogeneity.","Zhu, Jun-Hui; Chen, Zheng; Cheng, Chuan-Fang; Fan, Cui-Xia; Liu, Yu-Jun; He, Ming-Feng; Chen, Yue-Fang; Lai, Jin-Xing; Ye, Xiu-Ling; Chen, Yong-Jun; Wang, Jie; Li, Ya-Qin; NONE, NONE","Department of Neurology, The Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang 421002, China.; Department of Neurology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen 518107, China..

40912407,Integrating AUROC and SSMD for quality control in high-throughput screening assays.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) assays are pivotal in modern biomedical research, particularly in drug discovery and functional genomics. Ensuring the quality and reliability of HTS data is critical, especially when dealing with the small sample sizes that are typical in such assays. This study explores the integration of two powerful statistical metrics-Strictly Standardized Mean Difference (SSMD) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC)-for quality control (QC) in HTS. SSMD offers a standardized, interpretable measure of effect size, while AUROC provides a threshold-independent assessment of discriminative power. By establishing the theoretical and empirical relationships between AUROC and SSMD, we demonstrate how these metrics complement each other and enhance QC practices. We provide parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric estimation methods, and demonstrate the utility of the integrated framework in real HTS datasets. Our findings support the joint application of SSMD and AUROC as a robust and interpretable approach to improving QC in HTS, particularly under constraints of limited sample sizes of positive and negative controls.","Zhang, Xiaohua Douglas","Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington KY40536, USA.

40818745,"Review on Omics Approaches in Aquatic Animal Nutrition: Current Status, Limitations, and Perspectives.","This review synthesizes the research progress in applying omics to aquatic animal nutrition, highlighting their advantages as well as current limitations, and outlines future directions for development. Traditional nutritional research is often hampered by environmental variability, low precision, and the complexity of nutrient interactions across different tissues. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics, and functional genomics has driven the rapid emergence of various omics fields, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. These technologies overcome the limitations of traditional research methods, becoming powerful tools for investigating the regulatory mechanisms of nutrition in aquatic animals. Genomics and transcriptomics reveal genetic responses of aquatic animals to nutritional interventions, whereas proteomics and metabolomics enable large-scale analysis of proteins and metabolites, illuminating physiological changes under various nutritional conditions. Moreover, microbiomics provides crucial insights into the interactions between gut microbiota and host nutrient metabolism and immunity. Key applications such as gene editing and protein post-translational modification analysis further elucidate molecular mechanisms of nutritional regulation in fish. Despite significant advances, omics still faces persistent challenges, including technological complexity, ethical concerns, underdeveloped regulatory systems, ecological safety risks, and issues related to data storage and sharing. Addressing these through technological innovation, improved regulatory frameworks, and the expansion of application areas will be crucial for the sustainable advancement of omics in aquatic animal nutrition research.","Zhang, Jian; Li, Ming; Meng, Delong; Xu, Shichang; Teame, Tsegay; Yao, Yuanyuan; Yang, Yalin; Zhang, Zhen; Ran, Chao; Jijakli, M Haissam; Ding, Qianwen; Zhou, Zhigang","Sino-Norway Joint Lab on Fish Gastrointestinal Microbiota, Institute of Feed Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.; Sino-Norway Joint Lab on Fish Gastrointestinal Microbiota, Institute of Feed Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China; Department of Aquaculture and Fisheries, Tigray Agricultural Research Institute (TARI), Mekelle, Tigray, Ethiopia.; Key Laboratory for Feed Biotechnology of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Institute of Feed Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.; Integrated and Urban Plant Pathology Laboratory, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liège, Gembloux, Belgium.; National Collection of Livestock and Aquatic Microbes, Institute of Feed Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.

Given their rarity in these countries, such diagnoses of heterophyid flukes can be particularly difficult. The stool of a 70-year-old Laotian woman with eosinophilia was sent to the laboratory for examination. Microscopic observations based on direct examination and two concentration methods were performed on the fecal sample. After extraction of DNA from the sample, Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene was carried out. Ellipsoid eggs with a convex operculum and abopercular knob were observed on microscopic examination, suggestive of fluke eggs, but there was no morphological criterion to distinguish between opisthorchiid and heterophyid eggs. Results of ITS2 and cox1 sequencing matched the intestinal fluke Haplorchis taichui. This case report points out that small trematode eggs can hardly be used to distinguish between opisthorchiid and heterophyid flukes in fecal examinations, and underlines the need for molecular genomic studies to establish an accurate species diagnosis.","Luzarraga, Victor; Moniot, Maxime; Combes, Patricia; Legay, Mathilde; Poirier, Philippe; Nourrisson, Céline","Cabinet de Médecine Générale, Marssac-sur-Tarn, France.; Service de Parasitologie-Mycologie, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, 3IHP, Clermont-Ferrand, France; Microbes, Intestin, Inflammation et Susceptibilité de l'Hôte (M2iSH), UMR Inserm/ Université Clermont Auvergne U1071, USC, INRAE, 1382, Clermont-Ferrand, France.

We show that particular genetic architectures, in terms of dominance, epistasis, and linkage, are likely to evolve to produce discrete morphs under disruptive selection. Recent genomic studies have revealed that causative mutations tend to cluster, sometimes as a result of chromosomal rearrangements, but we still know little about the molecular mechanisms of dominance and epistasis. Although disruptive selection can also lead to speciation, once an optimal genetic architecture has evolved, disruptive selection no longer promotes the evolution of assortative mating. For a better understanding of the conditions that promote or constrain speciation, it is necessary to address how fast such a genetic architecture can evolve.","Kitano, Jun; Kagawa, Kotaro; Tsuchimatsu, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Ryo; Yamamichi, Masato","Ecological Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.; Genetics Course, Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan; Theoretical Ecology and Evolution Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.; Ecological Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan; Genetics Course, Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.

40803170,Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase facilitates Mycoplasma synoviae colonisation in the lower respiratory system.,"Mycoplasma synoviae is a significant pathogen in commercial poultry, causing respiratory disease, synovitis, and reduced egg production. The live attenuated vaccine MS-H, derived from the virulent strain 86079/7NS (7NS) via random mutagenesis, is widely used for disease control. Comparative genomics of MS-H and 7NS revealed mutations in the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a key glycolysis pathway enzyme, as well as the essential GTPase ObgE and the peptide transporter OppF. To examine the role of GAPDH in pathogenicity and immunogenicity, a MS-H transformant complemented with a plasmid expressing the wild-type GAPDH (MS-H + gapdh) was compared in vivo to 7NS containing the empty plasmid (7NS + EP), MS-H with or without the empty plasmid (MS-H + EP), and MS-H complemented with obgE (MS-H + obgE) or oppF (MS-H + oppF). Six groups of 20 specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated with each transformant and MS-H, via aerosol and eye drop routes. Postmortem examinations at 2- and 3-week post-challenge (WPI) evaluated colonisation, serological responses, and respiratory lesions in the birds. While all strains colonised the upper respiratory tract, only 7NS + EP and MS-H + gapdh colonised the lower respiratory tract. The 7NS + EP group induced significantly higher airsac lesions and tracheal mucosal thickness when compared to the remaining groups. Early systemic antibody responses were also higher in birds inoculated with MS-H + gapdh and 7NS + EP at 2-WPI compared to other groups. Thus, GAPDH enhances the colonisation and immunogenicity of MS-H in the absence of pathological lesions.","Zare, Sahar; Marenda, Marc S; Arachchige, Sathya N Kulappu; Shil, Pollob; Shahid, Muhammad A; Kordafshari, Somayeh; Rodrigo, Chathuri H; Kawarizadeh, Amin; O'Rourke, Denise; Noormohammadi, Amir H","Asia-Pacific Centre for Animal Health, Melbourne Veterinary School, Faculty of Science, The University of Melbourne, Werribee, VIC, Australia.; Asia-Pacific Centre for Animal Health, Melbourne Veterinary School, Faculty of Science, The University of Melbourne, Werribee, VIC, Australia.

Thus, this study revealed the first complete genome of an Indian pigeonpox virus that belongs to the genus APV, followed by comparative genomics analysis. The entire genome of the present isolate (PPV/Pur-Od-4b/01/Ind) has 280058 bp nucleotide sequences with a GC content of 29.51 %. The unique feature of this complete genome revealed the presence of 270 open reading frames (ORFs) circumscribed by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 4689 bp at each end and the absence of recombination events. The concatenated amino acid phylogenetic tree deciphered the present isolate closely related to the feral pigeonpox virus derived from South Africa.

In this study, we employed an integrative omics strategy combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, endothelial cell functional assays, and transcriptomic correlation analysis to elucidate the molecular architecture of CVD. A GWAS conducted in a Taiwanese population identified two CVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms: VSTM2L rs1998049 and DPYSL2 rs1442887. Through eQTL analysis and endothelial functional assays, four QTLs (VSTM2L, RPRD1B, SAMHD1, and PNMA2) were found to significantly affect VEGF consumption, vWF expression, and endothelial tube formation. Co-expression and correlation analyses further linked these QTLs to key vascular effector genes, including VEGF, vWF, MMP9, and CCM2. A logistic regression model based on QTL expression profiles demonstrated high diagnostic performance (area under the curve, AUC = 0.898), highlighting their translational potential.

40780199,Whole-genome sequencing reveals three follicular lymphoma subtypes with distinct cell of origin and patient outcomes.,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by clinical, phenotypic, and genetic heterogeneity. Here, we conduct whole-genome sequencing on 131 Chinese FL samples and identify three clinically relevant genetic subtypes. These include C1, associated with favorable prognoses and enriched for BCL6-related translocations and mutations in the NOTCH/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/immune evasion pathways; C2, characterized by BCL2-IGH translocations and mutations in chromatin modifiers; and C3, associated with poorer prognosis, lacking BCL2-IGH/BCL6-related translocations but exhibiting more copy number variations. We validate these subtypes in an independent Western cohort (n = 227) using the same classification strategy. Transcriptionally, C1 and C3 tumors display signatures of activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), whereas C2 tumors resemble germinal center B cell-like DLBCL. Furthermore, C1 tumors are distinguished from C3 by exhibiting gene signatures of age-associated B cells and an inflamed tumor microenvironment. Our findings illustrate the molecular heterogeneity of FL and define subtypes with distinct cell of origin and clinical outcomes, offering opportunities for personalized therapeutic strategies.","Ren, Weicheng; Yang, Mingyu; Wang, Xianhuo; Nie, Man; Huang, Yuhua; Wan, Hui; Liu, Dongbing; Li, Xiaobo; Ye, Xiaofei; Meng, Bin; Jiang, Wenqi; Huang, Huiqiang; Li, Zhiming; Zhang, Huilai; Wu, Kui; Pan-Hammarström, Qiang","BGI Genomics, Shenzhen, China; HIM-BGI Omics Center, Hangzhou Institute of Medicine, Chinese Academy of Sciences, BGI Research, Hangzhou, China.

There are distinct population differences in the prevalence of strabismus and its subtypes. This study aimed to explore the genetic contributions to strabismus in different ancestral groups. Case-control. The <i>All of Us</i> Research Program includes genotypic and phenotypic data from a diverse population of adults (age ≥18 years at time of enrollment) across the United States. Among participants with whole-genome sequences available, strabismus cases were identified based on diagnosis codes from their electronic health record. Participants with conditions associated with acquired strabismus, such as trauma, thyroid eye disease, tumor, or stroke, were excluded from the case and control cohorts. The final cohort consisted of 1579 cases and 121 490 controls of European (EUR) ancestry, 235 cases and 40 602 controls of Admixed American (AMR) ancestry, and 365 cases and 53 577 controls of African American (AFR) ancestry. Individuals of other ancestral groups were not included due to small numbers of strabismus-affected participants. Genome-wide association study of common variants (minor allele frequency >1%) and rare variant association study at the gene level for strabismus. Individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with strabismus and genes with significant burden of rare variants in strabismus. Genome-wide association study identified one locus with 3 significant SNPs (rs2247113, rs2667037, and rs2715926) in intron 1 of <i>PLA2R1</i> in the AFR group, and 2 loci, one in <i>RIMBP2</i> intron (rs184071225) and one intergenic (rs191788703), in the AMR group.

40820594,The genomic design of fruit metabolomes.,"As a major source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, fruits are critical to global nutritional security. Domestication and crop improvement have increased fruit yield and disease resistance but reduced flavor and aroma. With the rapid development of multi-omics, including genomics and metabolomics, and gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, it has become feasible to improve fruit quality through genome design. However, the sensory traits of fruits, including sweetness, sourness, aroma, and color, are complex and regulated by multiple genes, presenting challenges for the study of their genetic basis. Metabolomics, when combined with reverse genetics, reflects gene expression and protein-protein interactions underlying fruit sensory traits more intuitively than other omics approaches. Establishing correlations between metabolites and phenotypic changes and integrating metabolomics with other omics data are crucial aspects of metabolomics research on fruit quality and genomics-assisted breeding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research on the metabolomics of fruit sensory traits, alongside future prospects for integrating genomic design with metabolomics. It aims to deepen the understanding of multi-omics technologies, promote the application and advancement of metabolomics in fruit research, and establish a robust theoretical foundation for improving fruit sensory quality.","Xue, Hui; Liu, Zhongjie; Liu, Wenwen; Huang, Guizhou; Wang, Xu; Du, Mengrui; Li, Chaochao; Xu, Xiaodong; Li, Jiacui; Yang, Xuanwen; Xiao, Hua; Peng, Yanling; Zhou, Yongfeng","National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China; National Key Laboratory for Tropical Crop Breeding, Hainan Key Laboratory for Biosafety Monitoring and Molecular Breeding in Off-Season Reproduction Regions, Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Resources of Tropical Crops, Institute of Tropical Bioscience and Biotechnology, Sanya Research Institute, Coconut Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, China.; National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China; National Key Laboratory of Tropical Crop Breeding, Tropical Crops Genetic Resources Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Haikou, China.

40816443,Desert ecosystems shape diversification in glossy snakes (genus Arizona) requiring a re-alignment of evolutionary and conservation units.,"Subspecies are often targets for conservation, yet many lack the genetic data necessary to validate their status as distinctive evolutionary lineages. In 2016, conservationists faced this issue when designating the California glossy snake, Arizona elegans occidentalis, as a Species of Special Concern in California, a decision prompted by population declines and habitat loss but absent of genetic information about its evolutionary integrity. To address this knowledge gap, we collected genomic and mitochondrial data from a rangewide sample of the Arizona elegans complex (n = 257) and characterized genetic structure at varying spatial scales. We confirmed an east-west phyletic division within the A. elegans complex that correlates with an ecotone between the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts and pinpoint the separation to a ∼20 km area in southeastern Arizona, USA. Individuals recognized as A. e. occidentalis do not form a genetically cohesive unit within a more inclusive western clade that is sister to the endemic Arizona pacata in Baja California, México. We synonymize four subspecies circumscribed by the western clade and recognize a new species Arizona occidentalis to re-align the taxonomy with the phylogeographic structure. Most of the diversity within A. occidentalis occurs in California, with three major lineages corresponding separate desert biomes. We revise the conservation units within A. occidentalis to mirror these lineages and address concerns regarding habitat loss in transitional environments along the western edge of its range. This work underscores the importance of aligning taxonomy, evolutionary identity, and management units to design the most effective conservation strategies.","Wood, Dustin A; Richmond, Jonathan Q; Westphal, Michael F; Hollingsworth, Bradford D; Fisher, Robert N; Vandergast, Amy G","U.S. Geological Survey, 4165 Spruance Rd.

40865667,"Hidden diversity in the driest desert on Earth: genomics unveils cryptic diversity in an ancient South American gecko lineage (Phyllodactylidae, Garthia).","Quantifying and delimiting biodiversity is a critical challenge in modern biology, particularly in taxa where species boundaries are unclear or poorly defined. In many cases, traditional morphological approaches are insufficient or even misleading when delimiting taxonomic units. Modern genomic methods offer a powerful tool to gain an in-depth perspective of evolutionary history and genetic variation across populations. The Chilean Marked Geckos (genus Garthia) currently comprise two species, G. gaudichaudii and G. penai, endemic to the semi-arid coastal regions of North-Central Chile. Although additional species/subspecies have been proposed, a recent study went so far as to suggest that just one species should be recognized. However, no study to date has evaluated their diversity using genetic tools. For the first time, we used phylogenomic and population genetic methods to better understand diversity across the entire distribution of Garthia. Using both mtDNA and nDNA data, we reconstruct the phylogeny, assess population structure, and delimit species. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal deep evolutionary divergence strongly supporting the existence of at least the two nominate species.

40889621,Genome-based phylogenetics and species delimitation for the narrowly distributed Pachyhynobius salamander (Caudata: Hynobiidae) reveal cryptic biodiversity.,"Species delimitation is a challenging issue in taxonomy, especially in the absence of clear diagnostic morphological characters, a particular problem for cryptic species. In recent years, the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, when combined with genomic species delimitation methods such as the multispecies coalescent, has significantly improved the ability to resolve cryptic species. However, traditional methods like Bayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography often result in over-splitting due to their failure to fully consider factors such as gene flow. This study focuses on the genus Pachyhynobius, endemic to China, utilizing specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing technology to construct a high-quality nuclear genome SNP dataset. Systematic genomics combined with various species delimitation methods that incorporate the genealogical differentiation index and the isolation by distance model for geographic information was used to systematically evaluate the species boundaries of this genus. The results show that Pachyhynobius consists of four genetically independent, geographically disjunct lineages with deep genetic differentiation occurring over millions of years. Although these lineages have relatively close geographic distributions, long-term ecological niche conservatism and the sky island effect may be key driving forces responsible for their continued isolation and independent evolutionary paths. Multi-method species delimitation analysis further provides a comprehensive evaluation of the potentially distinct genetic lineages within the group, identifying them as potential cryptic species. Although new species have not yet been formally named, the evidence provided offers a new example for understanding the identification and evolutionary mechanisms of cryptic species in geographically restricted habitats.","Xiao, Yongxuan; Hu, Tingli; Shi, Suxin; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Caiwen; Pang, Dapeng; Cai, Yinfan; Pan, Tao; Orozco-terWengel, Pablo; Zhang, Baowei","Anhui Key Laboratory of Eco-engineering and Bio-technique, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601 Anhui, China; College of Food and Bioengineering, Bengbu University, Bengbu, Anhui 233030, China.; Anhui Key Laboratory of Eco-engineering and Bio-technique, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601 Anhui, China; School of Life Sciences, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241000 Anhui, China.; Anhui Key Laboratory of Eco-engineering and Bio-technique, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601 Anhui, China.; Anhui Key Laboratory of Eco-engineering and Bio-technique, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601 Anhui, China.

40915635,"An integrated framework for evolution of ciliated protists (Protista, Ciliophora) from the perspective of comparative genomics.","Early-branching eukaryotes are associated with the early branching events during eukaryogenesis. Understanding their genomic diversity and evolution can provide insights into the origin and speciation of eukaryotes. Ciliated protists (ciliates) are a group of early-branching unicellular eukaryotes with a high biodiversity, making them excellent models for evolutionary studies. However, their genomic diversity and evolution remain insufficiently understood. In this study, the comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses were conducted using well-annotated macronuclear genomes from 16 bulk-cultured ciliates across four major classes. Our results indicate that: a) ciliates exhibit significant genomic diversity, with genome sizes ranging from 18.4 Mb to 117.1 Mb, extensive stop codon rearrangements, and tens of thousands of nanochromosomes in Spirotrichea and Litostomatea, reflecting dynamic genome architecture and adaptive evolution; b) gene family expansions highlight divergent evolutionary trajectories among ciliate classes, with Heterotrichea enhancing cell division capacity and Spirotrichea focusing on signal transduction; c) phylogenetic and structural analyses of meiosis related zinc finger protein and calcium channel related calmodulin gene families indicate that they predate the divergence of ciliates with functional diversification; d) anaerobic Entodinium caudatum retains abundant ubiquitin-related genes, while halotolerant Fabrea salina enriches anaphase-promoting complex cofactors (a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase), suggesting that the encystment might be enhanced for both species. In summary, we systematically investigated the genomic landscape of ciliates to broaden our understanding of the genomic diversity and evolutionary patterns of ciliates.","Wang, Yuexin; Jin, Didi; Hou, Xiaopeng; Al-Rasheid, Khaled A S; Shao, Chen; Zhang, Tengteng","Zoology Department, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.; Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolution of Protozoa, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China.; Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolution of Protozoa, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710119, China.

40856292,Unlocking mental health insights with UK Biobank data: Past use and future opportunities.,"UK Biobank (UKB) is a large-scale, prospective resource offering significant opportunities for mental health research. Data include genetic and biological data, healthcare linkage, and mental health enhancements. Challenges arise from incomplete linkage of some sources and the incomplete coverage for enhancements, which also occur at different times post-baseline. We searched for publications using UKB for mental health research from 2016 to 2023 to describe and inspire future use. Papers were classified by mental health topic, 'additional' aspects, and the data used to define the mental health topic. We identified 480 papers, with 338 focusing on mental health disorder topics (affective, anxiety, psychotic, multiple, and transdiagnostic). The most commonly studied disorder was depression (41%). The most common single method of ascertaining mental disorder status was the Mental Health Questionnaire (26%), with genetic risk, for example, using polygenic risk scores, also frequent (21%). Common additional aspects included brain imaging, gene-environment interaction, and the relationship with physical health. The review demonstrates the value of UKB to mental health research. We explore the strengths and weaknesses, producing resources informed by the review. A strength is the flexibility: conventional epidemiological studies are present, but also genomics, imaging, and other tools for understanding mental health. A major weakness is selection effects. UKB continues to hold potential, especially with additional data continuing to become available.","Davis, Katrina A S; Mirza, Luwaiza; Clark, Scott R; Coleman, Jonathan R I; Kassam, Aliyah S; Mills, Natalie T; Zadow, Amy; McIntosh, Andrew M; Hotopf, Matthew","University of Adelaide, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, South Australia, Australia.; University of Edinburgh, Division of Psychiatry, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, Biomedical Research Centre, London, England, UK.; West London NHS Trust, Mental Health Services, London, England, UK.; King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, England, UK.; University of Adelaide, Discipline of Psychiatry, South Australia, Australia.",Psychological medicine,Psychol Med,"Humans, United Kingdom, Biological Specimen Banks, Mental Disorders, Mental Health, Biomedical Research, UK Biobank",2025,08,26,2025,09,04,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40856292,10.1017/S0033291725101359,40856292,0,0,NONE

Metabologenomics, the synergistic integration of metabolomics and genomics, has emerged as a powerful strategy to circumvent these challenges, enabling targeted discovery of new chemical entities. In this study, we developed a 2D-NMR-based metabologenomics workflow integrated with high-throughput activity screening to rapidly identify a novel family of antibiotic macrolides, samsumycins (<b>1</b>-<b>6</b>), from the deep-sea <i>Streptomyces</i> sp.

This system obviated the need for processing elements and achieved up to 100% gene disruption efficiency, as demonstrated by targeting the <i>sorB</i> gene. Furthermore, this platform enabled 100% single gene deletion and efficient large-scale chromosomal deletion, up to 66.17 kb within the sorbicillinoid biosynthetic gene cluster, without donor DNA. To our knowledge, this represents the largest chromosomal deletion reported in <i>A. chrysogenum</i> to date.

40910264,Genome-Wide Simplification of the AcMNPV Genome Using Synthetic Biology.,"Large-scale genome simplification represents a fundamental goal in synthetic biology. Baculoviruses, with their biphasic life cycle and inherent genomic plasticity, have emerged as ideal models for synthetic genome engineering. Although modified baculovirus genomes are widely used as expression vectors for robust recombinant protein production, many genomic regions are dispensable for in vitro budded virus (BV) production. In this study, guided by the synthetic biology ""design-build-test-learn"" framework, we systematically reduced the genome of the Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and obtained synthetic viruses capable of producing BVs. Building upon our previous work on whole-genome synthesis and partial genome reduction, we developed a strategy to rescue viruses by cotransfecting linearized genome fragments into host cells, thereby accelerating the iterative evaluation of genomic deletions. A total of 35 reduced genomes of varying sizes were synthesized, and the titers of the corresponding rescued viruses were measured. The most reduced functional genome, AcMNPV-Syn-mini, corresponds to the deletion of approximately 28 kb encompassing 39 nonessential genes. We analyze and discuss the gene organization and characteristics of this minimized genome. Our findings provide a foundation for the development of high-capacity baculoviral vectors and contribute to a deeper understanding of baculovirus functional genomics.","Guo, Yijia; Hu, Hengrui; Xiao, Han; Wang, Xi; Ke, Xiquan; Li, Jiang; Wang, Manli; Hu, Zhihong","State Key Laboratory of Virology and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, China.",ACS synthetic biology,ACS Synth Biol,,2025,09,05,2025,09,05,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40910264,10.1021/acssynbio.5c00156,40910264,0,0,NONE

40921766,"Augmenting cost-effectiveness in clinical diagnosis using extended whole-exome sequencing: SNVs, SVs, and beyond.","In standard short-read whole-exome sequencing (WES), capture probes are typically designed to target the protein-coding regions (CDS), and regions outside the exons-except for adjacent intronic sequences-are rarely sequenced. Although the majority of known pathogenic variants reside within the CDS as nonsynonymous variants, some disease-causing variants are located in regions that are difficult to detect by WES alone, such as deep intronic variants and structural variants, often requiring whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for detection. Moreover, WES has limitations in reliably identifying pathogenic variants within mitochondrial DNA or repetitive regions. Here, we propose a strategy to improve the diagnostic yield in a cost-effective manner by expanding the target design of WES beyond the CDS. As an illustrative example, we experimentally validated an extended WES approach covering intronic and untranslated regions (UTRs) of 188 genes listed in the Japanese public health insurance-covered multiple gene testing, intronic and UTRs of 81 genes listed in ACMG Secondary Findings (SF) v3.2, and 70 repeat regions associated with diseases. Additionally, the entire mitochondrial genome was targeted. We demonstrate the coverage of these extended regions based on experimental data and present case examples in which previously diagnosed pathogenic variants located outside the CDS were successfully detected using this approach. This strategy enables a substantial increase in the chance of achieving a definitive diagnosis for patients using WES alone, without requiring WGS, at a cost comparable to conventional WES. Our method has the potential to significantly shorten the diagnostic odyssey and represents a valuable approach in clinical genomics.","Miya, Fuyuki; Nakato, Daisuke; Suzuki, Hisato; Yamada, Mamiko; Watanabe, Daisuke; Takenouchi, Toshiki; Kosaki, Kenjiro","Department of Child Neurology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.; Department of Pediatrics, Yamanashi University, Yamanashi, Japan.; Department of Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.; Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. fmiya@keio.jp.",Journal of human genetics,J Hum Genet,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,24K14705_NONE_MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)_; JP24ek0109549_NONE_Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)_; JP24ek0109672_NONE_Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40921766,10.1038/s10038-025-01403-4,40921766,0,0,NONE

A total of 70 PRS-associated phenotypes encompassing discovered and never-reported phenotypes were identified, thereby facilitating applications in SA identification (area under the curve of 84%). Different with the existing observational studies, the causal effects between brain and SA were explored. Mendelian randomization supported a potential causal effect of right hippocampal gray matter volume on SA, whereas SA had a reverse causal effect on the VI cerebellum.

Implementation, however, varies greatly by application and jurisdiction, with a diversity of approaches being employed around the world. This review aims to summarise the current state of implementation of genomic testing in mainstream healthcare for the detection of rare disease throughout the lifespan. Through a discussion of evidence gathered to date, highlighting exemplar studies, the following applications of genomic testing will be covered: (1) routine diagnostic genomic testing in the clinic; (2) rapid diagnostic genomic testing in the intensive care unit; (3) genomic newborn screening; and, (4) reproductive genetic carrier screening. Mainstream implementation necessarily extends beyond the clinical genetics service, where genomic testing has historically been offered. Given that the involvement of non-genetics clinicians in the delivery of these technologies has important implications for models of care and education, related areas of growing evidence are also discussed: (5) genetic counsellors working outside clinical genetics services; and, (6) workforce development considerations for mainstream genomics. The diversity of approaches and examples illustrates that integration of genomic technologies into mainstream healthcare is complex and requires significant health system transformation. Efforts to evaluate services, guided by implementation science, will be essential to ensure lessons are shared across jurisdictions and benefit is delivered to patients and the system at-large.","Mackley, Michael P; Agrawal, Pankaj B; Ali, Sara S; Archibald, Alison D; Dawson-McClaren, Belinda; Ellard, Holly; Freeman, Lucinda; Gu, Yuanyuan; Jayasinghe, Kushani; Jiang, Shan; Kirk, Edwin P; Lewis, Celine; McEwen, Alison; Nisselle, Amy; Quinlan, Catherine; Terrill, Bronwyn; Tutty, Erin; McNeill, Alisdair","Department of Clinical Genetics, Melbourne Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Sheffield Clinical Genetics Service, Sheffield Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK.; Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Australian Genomics, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Graduate School of Health, Faculty of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Department of Nephrology, Monash Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and Holtz Children's Hospital, Jackson Health System, Miami, FL, USA.; Centre for Clinical Genetics, Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Genomics in Society, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Population, Policy and Practice Department, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health, London, UK.; Division of Neuroscience and Neuroscience Institute, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Kidney Regeneration, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Division of Clinical & Metabolic Genetics, Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada. michael.mackley@mail.utoronto.ca.; Department of Nephrology, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; NSW Health Pathology Randwick Genomics Laboratory, Randwick, NSW, Australia.; Macquarie University Centre for the Health Economy, Macquarie Business School and Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; School of Clinical Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,Eur J Hum Genet,,2025,08,22,2025,08,22,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40846792,10.1038/s41431-025-01925-7,40846792,0,0,NONE
40836024,MINDDS-connect: a federated data platform integrating biobanks for meta cohort building and analysis.,"Access to large patient cohort data and biobanked resources is a catalyst for progress in genomics and biomedical research, increasing statistical power, and unlocking deeper insights-especially in areas like rare diseases and mental health. Responsible research necessitates maintenance of data privacy, regulatory compliance, and research standardization. It can appear that these guiding principles oppose each other and present barriers to responsible Open science. To address these critical challenges, we developed MINDDS-Connect, a federated data collaboration platform that integrates a web-based interface with decentralized Docker instances via a REST API. This architecture allows registered users to securely query samples across the platform's network, and offers a tool to facilitate the formation of virtual multi-centric meta-cohorts and research collaboration.

40830342,Genetic determinants of pOXA-48 plasmid maintenance and propagation in Escherichia coli.,"Conjugative plasmids are the main drivers of antibiotic resistance dissemination contributing to the emergence and extensive spread of multidrug resistance clinical bacterial pathogens. pOXA-48 plasmids, belonging to the IncL group, emerge as the primary vehicle for carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. Despite the problematic prevalence of pOXA-48, most research focus on epidemiology and genomics, leaving gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms behind its propagation. In this study, we use a transposon sequencing approach to identify genetic elements critical for plasmid stability, replication, and conjugative transfer. Our results identify a novel type I toxin-antitoxin system, uncharacterized essential maintenance factors, and components of the type IV secretion system and regulatory elements crucial for conjugation. This study advances our understanding of pOXA-48 biology, providing key insights into the genetic factors underlying its successful maintenance and spread in bacterial populations.","Baffert, Yannick; Fraikin, Nathan; Makhloufi, Yasmine; Baltenneck, Julie; Val, Marie-Eve; Dedieu-Berne, Annick; Degosserie, Jonathan; Iorga, Bogdan I; Bogaerts, Pierre; Gueguen, Erwan; Lesterlin, Christian; Bigot, Sarah","National reference center for antimicrobial resistance in Gram negative, CHU UCL Namur, Yvoir, Belgium.; Microbiologie Adaptation et Pathogénie (MAP), Université Lyon 1, INSA de Lyon, CNRS, UMR 5240, Villeurbanne, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, CNRS UMR3525, Unité Plasticité du Génome Bactérien, Département Génomes et Génétique, Paris, France.; Microbiologie Moléculaire et Biochimie Structurale (MMSB), Université Lyon 1, CNRS, Inserm, UMR5086, Lyon, France.; Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS UPR 2301, Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.; Namur Molecular Tech, UCLouvain, CHU UCL Namur, Yvoir, Belgium.; Microbiologie Moléculaire et Biochimie Structurale (MMSB), Université Lyon 1, CNRS, Inserm, UMR5086, Lyon, France. sarah.bigot@cnrs.fr.",Nature communications,Nat Commun,"Plasmids, Escherichia coli, Conjugation, Genetic, DNA Transposable Elements, Escherichia coli Proteins, Toxin-Antitoxin Systems, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Type IV Secretion Systems",2025,08,19,2025,08,24,ANR-19CE12-0001_NONE_Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency)_; ANR-22-CE35-0017_NONE_Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency)_; ANR-22-CE12-0032_NONE_Agence Nationale de la Recherche (French National Research Agency)_; EQU202103012587_NONE_Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (Foundation for Medical Research in France)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40830342,10.1038/s41467-025-62404-7,40830342,0,,
40847023,GraphVelo allows for accurate inference of multimodal velocities and molecular mechanisms for single cells.,"RNA velocities and generalizations emerge as powerful approaches for extracting time-resolved information from high-throughput snapshot single-cell data. Yet, several inherent limitations restrict applying the approaches to genes not suitable for RNA velocity inference due to complex transcriptional dynamics, low expression, or lacking splicing dynamics, or data of non-transcriptomic modality. Here, we present GraphVelo, a graph-based machine learning procedure that uses as input the RNA velocities inferred from existing methods and infers velocity vectors lying in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold formed by the single cell data. GraphVelo preserves vector magnitude and direction information during transformations across different data representations. Tests on synthetic and experimental single-cell data, including viral-host interactome, multi-omics, and spatial genomics datasets demonstrate that GraphVelo, together with downstream generalized dynamo analyses, extends RNA velocities to multi-modal data and reveals quantitative nonlinear regulation relations between genes, virus, and host cells, and different layers of gene regulation.","Chen, Yuhao; Zhang, Yan; Gan, Jiaqi; Ni, Ke; Chen, Ming; Bahar, Ivet; Xing, Jianhua","Department of Computational and Systems Biology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; University of Pittsburgh Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. xing1@pitt.edu.; Department of Bioinformatics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China. mchen@zju.edu.cn.; Department of Computational and Systems Biology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. xing1@pitt.edu.; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. xing1@pitt.edu.; Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Multi-omics Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Diseases, Department of General Surgery, Sir Run-Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 310016, Hangzhou, China. mchen@zju.edu.cn.; Department of Bioinformatics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, and Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA. bahar@laufercenter.org.",Nature communications,Nat Commun,"Single-Cell Analysis, Machine Learning, Humans, RNA, Algorithms, Gene Expression Regulation, Computational Biology",2025,08,22,2025,08,28,R01 GM139297_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; 1R01GM148525_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_; 1R01GM139297_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_; R01 GM148525_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40847023,10.1038/s41467-025-62784-w,40847023,0,0,NONE
40858551,Bringing the uncultivated microbial majority of freshwater ecosystems into culture.,"Axenic cultures are essential for studying microbial ecology, evolution, and genomics. Despite the importance of pure cultures, public culture collections are biased towards fast-growing copiotrophs, while many abundant aquatic prokaryotes remain uncultured due to uncharacterized growth requirements and oligotrophic lifestyles. Here, we applied high-throughput dilution-to-extinction cultivation using defined media that mimic natural conditions to samples from 14 Central European lakes, yielding 627 axenic strains. These cultures include 15 genera among the 30 most abundant freshwater bacteria identified via metagenomics, collectively representing up to 72% of genera detected in the original samples (average 40%) and are widespread in freshwater systems globally. Genome-sequenced strains are closely related to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the same samples, many of which remain undescribed. We propose a classification of several novel families, genera, and species, including many slowly growing, genome-streamlined oligotrophs that are notoriously underrepresented in public repositories. Our large-scale initiative to cultivate the ""uncultivated microbial majority"" has yielded a valuable collection of abundant freshwater microbes, characterized by diverse metabolic pathways and lifestyles. This culture collection includes promising candidates for oligotrophic model organisms, suitable for a wide array of ecological studies aimed at advancing our ecological and functional understanding of dominant, yet previously uncultured, taxa.","Salcher, Michaela M; Layoun, Paul; Fernandes, Clafy; Chiriac, Maria-Cecilia; Bulzu, Paul-Adrian; Ghai, Rohit; Shabarova, Tanja; Lanta, Vojtech; Callieri, Cristiana; Sonntag, Bettina; Posch, Thomas; Lepori, Fabio; Znachor, Petr; Haber, Markus","Water Research Institute (IRSA) - National Research Council (CNR), Verbania, Italy.; Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.; University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), Mendrisio, Switzerland.; Research Department for Limnology, Mondsee, University of Innsbruck, Mondsee, Austria.; Institute of Hydrobiology, Biology Centre CAS, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.; Limnological Station, University of Zurich, Kilchberg, Switzerland.; Department of Functional Ecology, Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Průhonice, Czech Republic.; Institute of Hydrobiology, Biology Centre CAS, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. michaelasalcher@gmail.com.",Nature communications,Nat Commun,"Bacteria, Fresh Water, Ecosystem, Metagenomics, Lakes, Metagenome, Phylogeny, Genome, Bacterial",2025,08,26,2025,08,29,25-15813S_NONE_Grantová Agentura České Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)_; 017/2022/P_NONE_Jihočeská Univerzita v Českých Budějovicích (University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice)_; 22-03662S_NONE_Grantová Agentura České Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)_; 19-23469S_NONE_Grantová Agentura České Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)_; 022/2019/P_NONE_Jihočeská Univerzita v Českých Budějovicích (University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice)_; 21-21990S_NONE_Grantová Agentura České Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)_; 20-12496X_NONE_Grantová Agentura České Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40858551,10.1038/s41467-025-63266-9,40858551,0,0,NONE

Among 369 subjects who received 3 months of SIM01, a gut microbiota-derived synbiotic formula of three Bifidobacterium strains (B. adolescentis, B. bididum, and B. longum) or a placebo after the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or the inactivated vaccine Sinovac-CoronaVac), we performed metagenomic sequencing in stool samples of 280 vaccinees collected at baseline and 3-month postvaccination and metabonomic sequencing in 276 vaccinees collected at baseline and 1-month postvaccination. The open niche of autochthonous gut microbiota (lower levels of Bifidobacterium and decreased functional potential for carbohydrate metabolism) was associated with enhancing SIM01-contained species. The enrichment of three bifidobacterial species after 3 months of SIM01 intervention (BABBBL_fc) was positively correlated with the level of neutralizing antibodies to the BNT162b2 vaccine at 6-month postvaccination. The fold change of benzoic acid was positively correlated with BABBBL_fc in the BNT162b2 vaccinees, which was also implicated with SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)% levels at 1-month postvaccination. Importantly, SIM01 strain engraftment assessed by StrainPhlAn (A metagenomic strain-level population genomics tool) was associated with a higher fold change of three bifidobacterial species and could be predicted based on the baseline gut microbiome. Therefore, the resident gut microbiome affected the SIM01 engraftment, which was associated with the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccines.","Zhang, Lin; Wang, Shilan; Wong, Martin C S; Mok, Chris K P; Ching, Jessica Y L; Mak, Joyce W Y; Chen, Chunke; Huo, Bing; Yan, Shuai; Cheung, Chun Pan; Chiu, Emily O L; Fung, Emily Y T; Cheong, Pui Kuan; Chan, Francis K L; Ng, Siew C","SH Ho Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; New Cornerstone Science Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; New Cornerstone Science Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. siewchienng@cuhk.edu.hk.; Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, Institute of Digestive Disease, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China. siewchienng@cuhk.edu.hk.; Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; The D.H.

40790295,Integrated profiling of metaplastic breast cancer identifies putative master regulators of intratumoral heterogeneity.,"Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is defined by the presence of various morphological elements, typically biphasic, with epithelial (e.g. no-special type (NST), squamous) and mesenchymal (e.g. spindle, chondroid, osteoid) components. The established clonality of the different components favours an evolution model encompassing either a multipotent progenitor, or a linear metaplastic conversion. We used methylation profiling and showed that different morphologies have specific methylation profiles. Furthermore, our spatial transcriptomic approach, using 10× Genomics Visium and trajectory analysis, evidenced that spindle cells form a transition between the originating carcinoma of no-special type (NST) and pleomorphic regions, with osteoid differentiation likely to be an end-stage fate of the chondroid growth pattern, supporting the conversion model of lineage differentiation. We have also identified a series of master transcription factors likely to regulate these processes, and are significantly associated with metaplastic-like clinical features. This data further supports the conversion model of metaplasia and warrants functional analysis.","Feng, Yufan; Xiong, Albert; Mulay, Onkar; Sokolova, Anna; Lim, Malcolm; Van Haeringen, Benjamin; McGuire, Natasha; de Luca, Xavier; Simpson, Peter T; Nguyen, Quan; Lakhani, Sunil R; McCart Reed, Amy E","Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4029, Australia.; UQ Centre for Clinical Research, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4029, Australia.; Pathology Queensland, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, 4029, Australia.; Pathology Queensland, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, 4029, Australia. s.lakhani@uq.edu.au.; School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.; UQ Centre for Clinical Research, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4029, Australia. s.lakhani@uq.edu.au.; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, 4006, Australia.; UQ Centre for Clinical Research, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Behavioural Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4029, Australia. amy.reed@uq.edu.au.; Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology, Bowen Hills, Brisbane, 4006, Australia.",NPJ breast cancer,NPJ Breast Cancer,,2025,08,11,2025,08,16,"APP1113867_NONE_National Health and Medical Research Council_; APP1082435_NONE_Cancer Australia/National breast cancer foundation, Australia_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790295,10.1038/s41523-025-00807-x,40790295,0,,

In breast cancer, ctDNA has shown promise in both metastatic and early-stage settings. However, its application and benefits have not been equitably realized across all populations. In this review, we examined the current evidence on ctDNA detection, assay performance, and clinical utility specifically within racially, ethnically, and geographically underrepresented populations. We synthesized data from genomic studies, ctDNA-based trials, and implementation research to identify disparities in ctDNA levels, mutational profiles, testing utilization, and access to genotype-matched therapies. These disparities were further compounded by structural barriers such as insurance coverage, geographic access, and limited inclusion in clinical research. Global data from low- and middle-income countries reinforced both the feasibility and the challenges of ctDNA implementation in resource-constrained settings. While ctDNA holds considerable potential to personalize breast cancer care, our findings underscore the urgent need to integrate equity into its validation, clinical application, and policy development to avoid perpetuating existing disparities.","Aronson, Julia; Bhatta, Manasa; Carey, Lisa A; Jobanputra, Kunal; Gupta, Gaorav P; Abdou, Yara","Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. yara_abdou@med.unc.edu.; Department of Medical Oncology, MOC Cancer Care & Research Centre, Mumbai, India.; Department of Radiation Oncology, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.",NPJ breast cancer,NPJ Breast Cancer,,2025,08,16,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40819167,10.1038/s41523-025-00811-1,40819167,0,,
40790265,Predicted deleterious mutations reveal the genetic architecture of male reproductive success in a lekking bird.,"Deleterious mutations are ubiquitous in natural populations and, when expressed, reduce fitness. However, the specific nature of these mutations and the ways in which they impact fitness remain poorly understood. We exploited recent advances in genomics to predict deleterious mutations in the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), an iconic lekking species. Analysis of 190 whole genomes alongside comprehensive life-history data including repeated measures of behavioural, ornamental and fitness traits revealed that deleterious mutations identified through evolutionary conservation and functional prediction are associated with reduced male lifetime mating success. Both homozygous and heterozygous deleterious mutations reduce fitness, indicating that fully and partially recessive mutations contribute towards an individual's realized mutation load. Notably, deleterious mutations in promotors have disproportionally negative fitness effects, suggesting that they impair an individual's ability to dynamically adjust gene expression to meet context-dependent functional demands. Finally, deleterious mutations impact male mating success by reducing lek attendance rather than by altering the expression of ornamental traits, suggesting that behaviour serves as an honest indicator of genetic quality. These findings offer insights into the genetic architecture of male fitness and illuminate the complex interplay between genetic variation and phenotypic expression.","Chen, R S; Soulsbury, C D; Hench, K; van Oers, K; Hoffman, J I","Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec), Faculty of Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.; School of Natural Sciences, Joseph Banks Laboratories, University of Lincoln, Lincoln, UK.; British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.; Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), Wageningen, the Netherlands.; Behavioural Ecology Group, Wageningen University & Research (WUR), Wageningen, the Netherlands.; Department of Evolutionary Population Genetics, Faculty of Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.; Department of Evolutionary Population Genetics, Faculty of Biology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany. rebecca.chen@uni-bielefeld.de.; Joint Institute for Individualisation in a Changing Environment (JICE), Bielefeld University and University of Münster, Bielefeld, Germany.",Nature ecology & evolution,Nat Ecol Evol,,2025,08,11,2025,08,12,7119165_NONE_Academy of Finland (Suomen Akatemia)_; 454606304_NONE_Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790265,10.1038/s41559-025-02802-8,40790265,0,,
40866482,A call for caution in the biological interpretation of viral auxiliary metabolic genes.,"Virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) are non-essential genes that increase viral fitness by maintaining or manipulating host metabolism during infection. AMGs are intriguing from an evolutionary perspective, as most viral genomes are highly compact and have limited coding capacity for accessory genes. Advances in viral (meta)genomics have expanded the detection of putative AMGs from viruses in diverse environments. However, this has also led to many instances of misannotation due to the limitations of annotation tools, resulting in misinterpretations about the roles of some viral genes. Here, we highlight studies that support claims about AMGs with more than just function predictions for guidance on best practices. We then propose the adoption of an expanded, inclusive view of all genes auxiliary to core viral functions with the term 'auxiliary viral genes' (AVGs), alongside an associated eco-evolutionary framework for considering the types of analyses that can better support claims made about AVGs.","Martin, Cody; Emerson, Joanne B; Roux, Simon; Anantharaman, Karthik","Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. karthik@bact.wisc.edu.; DOE Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. sroux@lbl.gov.; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. karthik@bact.wisc.edu.; Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Data Science and AI, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India. karthik@bact.wisc.edu.; Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA. jbemerson@ucdavis.edu.; Microbiology Doctoral Training Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.",Nature microbiology,Nat Microbiol,"Viruses, Genome, Viral, Genes, Viral, Evolution, Molecular, Genomics, Viral Proteins",2025,08,27,2025,09,03,DE-SC0021198_NONE_DOE | SC | Biological and Environmental Research (BER)_; DE-AC02-05CH11231_NONE_DOE | SC | Biological and Environmental Research (BER)_; R35GM143024_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40866482,10.1038/s41564-025-02095-4,40866482,0,0,NONE

40854979,Systema: a framework for evaluating genetic perturbation response prediction beyond systematic variation.,"Predicting transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations is challenging in functional genomics. While recent methods aim to infer effects of untested perturbations, their true predictive power remains unclear. Here, we show that current methods struggle to generalize beyond systematic variation, the consistent transcriptional differences between perturbed and control cells arising from selection biases or confounders. We quantify this variation in ten datasets, spanning three technologies and five cell lines, and show that common metrics are susceptible to these biases, leading to overestimated performance. To address this, we introduce Systema, an evaluation framework that emphasizes perturbation-specific effects and identifies predictions that correctly reconstruct the perturbation landscape. Using this framework, we uncover insights into the predictive capabilities of existing methods and show that predicting responses to unseen perturbations is substantially harder than standard metrics suggest.

40921789,Robust and accurate Bayesian inference of genome-wide genealogies for hundreds of genomes.,"The Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), which describes the genealogical history of a sample of genomes, is a vital tool in population genomics and biomedical research. Recent advancements have substantially increased ARG reconstruction scalability, but they rely on approximations that can reduce accuracy, especially under model misspecification. Moreover, they reconstruct only a single ARG topology and cannot quantify the considerable uncertainty associated with ARG inferences. Here, to address these challenges, we introduce SINGER (sampling and inferring of genealogies with recombination), a method that accelerates ARG sampling from the posterior distribution by two orders of magnitude, enabling accurate inference and uncertainty quantification for hundreds of whole-genome sequences. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate SINGER's enhanced accuracy and robustness to model misspecification compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the utility of SINGER by applying it to individuals of British and African descent within the 1000 Genomes Project, identifying signals of population differentiation, archaic introgression and strong support for ancient polymorphism in the human leukocyte antigen region shared across primates.","Deng, Yun; Nielsen, Rasmus; Song, Yun S","Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Center for GeoGenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu.; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. yss@berkeley.edu.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu.; Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. yss@berkeley.edu.; Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. rasmus_nielsen@berkeley.edu.",Nature genetics,Nat Genet,"Humans, Bayes Theorem, Genome, Human, Animals, Models, Genetic, Genetics, Population, Genomics, Recombination, Genetic, Pedigree, Computer Simulation, Evolution, Molecular",2025,09,08,2025,09,15,R56-HG013117_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; R35 GM153400_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R56 HG013117_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; R01-HG013117_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_; R01 HG013117_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM134922_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R35-GM134922_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_; R35-GM153400_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_; R01-HG013117_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40921789,10.1038/s41588-025-02317-9,40921789,0,0,NONE
40858906,Mutational landscape of triple-negative breast cancer in African American women.,"African American (AA) women have the highest incidence of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among all racial groups, but are underrepresented in cancer genomic studies. In 462 AA women with TNBC, we characterized the tumor mutational landscape by whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. We unveiled a high-resolution mutational portrait of TNBC in AA women reminiscent of that in Asian and non-Hispanic white women, with no evidence of associations of mutational features with African ancestry. We also made some distinctive discoveries, including an almost complete dominance of TP53 mutations, low frequency of PIK3CA mutations and mutational signature-based subtypes with etiologic and prognostic significance. These findings do not support major racial differences in TNBC biology at the level of somatic mutations. Our study contributes considerably to diversifying the knowledge base of breast cancer genomics and provides insights into the disease etiology, disparities and therapeutic vulnerability of TNBC in AA women.","Yao, Song; Wei, Lei; Hu, Qiang; Liu, Song; Manojlovic, Zarko; Fiorica, Peter N; Long, Mark; Zirpoli, Gary R; Cai, Qiuyin; Long, Jirong; Ping, Jie; Barnard, Mollie E; Jin, Yuxin; Murakami, Mitsuko; Wang, Jianmin; Zhu, Qianqian; Davis, Warren; Chen, Jianhong; Ondracek, Rochelle P; Khoury, Thaer; Gandhi, Shipra; Takabe, Kazuaki; Ko, Naomi; Sanderson, Maureen; Hong, Chi-Chen; Bandera, Elisa V; Craig, David W; Ambrosone, Christine B; Palmer, Julie R; Zheng, Wei; Carpten, John D","Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA. song.yao@roswellpark.org.; Department of Medical Oncology, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.; Department of Surgical Oncology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.; Section of Cancer Epidemiology and Health Outcomes, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.; Department of Translational Genomics, Keck School of Medicine of USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.; Department of Family and Community Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN, USA.; Slone Epidemiology Center, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pathology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Comprehensive Cancer Center, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.",Nature genetics,Nat Genet,"Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Black or African American, Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, Exome Sequencing, Mutation, Prognosis, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2025,08,26,2025,09,16,R01 CA185623_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA228156_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; UM1 CA164974_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; U01 CA164974_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01CA228156_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; R01CA100598_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; R01 CA100598_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; P30 CA068485_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; U54 CA091405_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA092447_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; U54CA91405_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; No award number_NONE_Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF)_; P30 CA016056_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA100374_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01CA100374_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; R01CA164974_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; U01 CA202979_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01CA092447_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; R01CA185623_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; U01CA202979_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; UM1CA164974_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40858906,10.1038/s41588-025-02322-y,40858906,0,0,NONE

Integrative analysis with genetic variants that underpin bovine monogenic and complex traits uncovers cell types of relevance, such as spermatocytes, responsible for sperm motility and excitatory neurons for milk fat yield. Comparative analysis reveals similarities in gene expression between cattle and humans, allowing for the detection of relevant cell types to study human complex phenotypes.

40890532,A practical guide to identifying associations between tandem repeats and complex human traits using consensus genotypes from multiple tools.,"Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly variable loci in the human genome that are linked to various human phenotypes. Accurate and reliable genotyping of TRs is important in understanding population TR variation dynamics and their effects in TR-trait association studies. In this protocol, we describe how to generate high-quality consensus TR genotypes for population genomics studies. In particular, we detail steps to: (i) perform TR genotyping from short-read whole-genome sequencing data by using the HipSTR, GangSTR, adVNTR and ExpansionHunter tools, (ii) perform quality control checks on TR genotypes by using TRTools and (iii) integrate TR genotypes from different tools by using EnsembleTR. We further discuss how to visualize and investigate TR variation patterns to identify population-specific expansions and perform TR-trait association analyses. We demonstrate the utility of these steps by analyzing a small dataset from the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition, we recapitulate a previously identified association between TR length and gene expression in the African population and provide a generalized discussion on TR analysis and its relevance to identifying complex traits. The expected time for installing the necessary software for each section is ~10 min. The expected run time on the user's desired dataset can vary from hours to days depending on factors such as the size of the data, input parameters and the capacity of the computing infrastructure.","Lujumba, Ibra; Adam, Yagoub; Ziaei Jam, Helyaneh; Isewon, Itunuoluwa; Monnakgotla, Nomakhosazana; Li, Yang; Onyido, Blessing; Fredrick, Kakembo; Adegoke, Faith; Emmanuel, Jerry; Adeyemi, Jumoke; Ibitoye, Olajumoke; Owusu-Ansah, Samuel; Akanle, Matthew Boladele; Joseph, Habi; Nsubuga, Mike; Galiwango, Ronald; Okitwi, Martin; Magdalene, Namuswe; Walter, Odur; Mngadi, Zama; Adebiyi, Marion; Oyelade, Jelili; Nel, Melissa; Jjingo, Daudi; Gymrek, Melissa; Adebiyi, Ezekiel","The African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Intensive Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; The African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Intensive Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. e.adebiyi@dkfz-heidelberg.de.; Covenant University Bioinformatics Research (CUBRe), Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. e.adebiyi@dkfz-heidelberg.de.; Neurogenomics Lab, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; The Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. e.adebiyi@dkfz-heidelberg.de.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Omu-Aran, Kwara State, Nigeria.; Neurology Research Group, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Department of Computer Science, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; The Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Covenant University Bioinformatics Research (CUBRe), Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.; Neuroscience Institute, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Applied Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. e.adebiyi@dkfz-heidelberg.de.; Covenant Applied Informatics and Communication Africa Center of Excellence (CApIC-ACE), Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.; Department of Computer & Information Sciences, Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",Nature protocols,Nat Protoc,,2025,09,01,2025,09,01,5U24HG006941_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; 1R01HG010149_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; 1U2CEB032224-01_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; R01HG010885_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; 1RM1HG011558_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; 1U2RTW010672-0_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_; 1U01HG013442-01_NONE_U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40890532,10.1038/s41596-025-01231-y,,,,

The haplotypic 614.19 Mb genome sequences were successfully anchored onto 24 chromosomes, demonstrating exceptional contiguity with a contig N50 of 26.57 Mb. Comprehensive annotation revealed precise localization of telomeric repeats and centromeric regions across various chromosomes. Good results from Merqury (QV: 57.8), CRAQ (99.45%) and BUSCO (100%) indicate a high level of accuracy for the assembled genome. ONT ultra-long and PacBio HiFi sequencing data were aligned with the assembly using minimap2, resulting in a mapping rate over 98%.

40835863,Chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of Amur Pike (Esox reichertii).,"Amur pike (Esox reicherti) is endemic to the Heilongjiang River system in Northeast Asia. Serving as a top predator in its ecosystem, Amur pike carries substantial significance in ecological, economic, and cultural dimensions. Molecular studies have firmly established that Esociformes is the sister group of Salmoniformes. Notably, unlike Salmoniformes, Esociformes has not undergone genomic duplication. In this study, we reported a chromosome-level genome assembly of Amur pike, the size of which is 976.47 Mb with a contig N50 of 30.76 Mb. Using Hi-C interaction information, a total of 948.05 Mb (98.51%) of the assembled sequences was successfully anchored and ordered onto 25 pseudochromosomes, ranged from 22.85 Mb to 56.71 Mb. Further analysis identified 368.55 Mb of repetitive sequences and 25,824 protein-coding genes in the genome. Among them, 98.80% (25,515) of the genes were functionally annotated. This high-quality genome could be a valuable resource for future studies of Amur pike.

40790052,Antimalarial drug resistance and population structure of Plasmodium falciparum in Mozambique using genomic surveillance at health facilities in 2021 and 2022.,"Monitoring the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites is essential for effective malaria control. Here, we describe the prevalence of genetic markers of Plasmodium falciparum antimalarial drug resistance and parasite population structure in Mozambique. Drug resistance loci and microhaplotypes were genotyped by multiplex targeted amplicon sequencing of 1146 P. falciparum samples collected in 2021 (n = 321) and 2022 (n = 825 rainy season, and n = 155 dry season). pfpm2 gene copy number (associated to piperaquine resistance) was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR. No pfk13 markers of partial artemisinin resistance nor pfpm2 duplications were observed. Prevalence of pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple mutants associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance was high across all regions (> 92.5% in 2021 and > 87.8% in 2022), but pfdhps-A581G mutation was rare (1.6% in 2021 and 0.8% 2022). Both prevalence of mutations in pfdhps-436 (p < 0.001) and genetic complexity of infections increased from South to North. These results support the continued use of artemisinin-based combination therapies in Mozambique, call for a close monitoring of chemopreventive efficacy based on SP, and confirm the spatial genetic distinction in P. falciparum population observed across the country.","Boene, Simone; Rovira-Vallbona, Eduard; da Silva, Clemente; García-Ulloa, Manuel; Rafael, Bernardete; Canana, Neide; Aranda-Díaz, Andrés; Cisteró, Pau; García-Fernández, Carla; Tembisse, Dário; Ndimande, Nelo; Chidimatembue, Arlindo; Matambisso, Glória; Palmer, Brian; Chico, Ana Rita; Dimene, Mércia; Saifodine, Abuchahama; Inácio, José; da Silva, Mariana; Plucinski, Mateusz; Bonnington, Craig; Wate, Flavio; de Carvalho, Eva; Mathe, Guidion; Pujol, Arnau; Arregui-Gallego, Beatriz; Comiche, Kiba; Nhama, Abel; Nhamussua, Lídia; Aide, Pedro; Saute, Francisco; Enosse, Sónia; Greenhouse, Bryan; Candrinho, Baltazar; Mayor, Alfredo","Centro de Investigação em Saúde de Manhiça (CISM), Maputo, Mozambique.; Spanish Consortium for Research in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.; ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain.; EPPIcenter Research Program, Division of HIV, Infectious Disease and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, USA.; Facultat de Medicina i Ciències de la Salut, Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Spain.; Facultat de Medicina i Ciències de la Salut, Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Spain. simone.boene@manhica.net.; Malaria Consortium, London, UK.; Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo, Mozambique.; World Health Organization, Maputo, Mozambique.; President's Malaria Initiative, USAID, Maputo, Mozambique.; National Malaria Control Program, Ministry of Health, Maputo, Mozambique.; ISGlobal, Barcelona, Spain. simone.boene@manhica.net.; Clinton Health Access Initiative, Maputo, Mozambique.; Centro de Investigação em Saúde de Manhiça (CISM), Maputo, Mozambique. simone.boene@manhica.net.; Malaria Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Instituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Marracuene, Mozambique.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Plasmodium falciparum, Mozambique, Antimalarials, Humans, Drug Resistance, Malaria, Falciparum, Sulfadoxine, Pyrimethamine, Mutation, Protozoan Proteins, Health Facilities, Artemisinins, Drug Combinations, Genotype, Piperazines, Quinolines",2025,08,11,2025,08,16,"PID2020-118328RB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033_NONE_Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación_; LCF/BQ/PR24/12050009_NONE_'la Caixa' Foundation_; INV-019032_GATES_Gates Foundation_United States; 890477_NONE_European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Spain_; 2022 FI_B 00148_NONE_Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca_; 2021 SGR 01517_NONE_Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790052,10.1038/s41598-025-02166-w,40790052,1,,[39975885]
40820167,Integration of multi-omics quantitative trait loci evidence reveals novel susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, significantly impacting health and socio-economic sectors. Our study aims to elucidate the molecular basis of AD using an integrated multi-omics approach. We utilized a combination of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data from multiple tissues (blood, cerebrospinal fluid and brain). Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), colocalization analysis and Heterogeneity in Dependent Instruments (HEIDI) analyses were conducted to establish causality between genetic variants and AD risk. Our results identified causal relationships across multiple omics layers, with significant findings for the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and CD33 molecule (CD33) genes. For ACE, our analyses across methylation, expression, and protein levels revealed an overall odds ratio (OR) indicating a protective effect against AD. Specifically, increased methylation at cg04199256 and cg21657705 was associated with higher ACE expression. CD33 demonstrated an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.25).Both genes showed strong colocalization signals, with ACE and CD33 having posterior probability values (PP.H4) of 0.99 and 0.95, respectively. The proteins TMEM106B (PP.H4 = 0.96), SIRPA (PP.H4 = 0.92), CTSH (PP.H4 = 0.77), and CLN5 (PP.H4 = 0.92) also showed strong colocalization evidence. At the protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of TMEM106B (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.24-1.68), SIRPA (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04) and CTSH (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06) was associated with an increased risk of AD; genetically predicted higher level of CLN5 were inversely associated with AD risk (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.83). By identifying multiple candidate targets and regulatory axes, our findings offer a valuable resource for prioritizing genes for functional validation and advancing future therapeutic development.","Gao, Jinyang; Bi, Xiaochan; Jiang, Wenjing; Wang, Yanqing","Department of Geriatrics & Laboratory of Gerontology and Anti-Aging Research, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.; School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.; School of Basic Medical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. flora.wangyanqing@yahoo.com.; Department of Geriatrics & Laboratory of Gerontology and Anti-Aging Research, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. jiangwenjing@qiluhospital.com.; The Second Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. flora.wangyanqing@yahoo.com.; Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA. flora.wangyanqing@yahoo.com.; Department of Neurology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.; Department of Neurology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. jiangwenjing@qiluhospital.com.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Humans, Alzheimer Disease, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Quantitative Trait Loci, Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3, Mendelian Randomization Analysis, Genomics, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Proteomics, DNA Methylation, Multiomics, Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",2025,08,18,2025,09,14,82201383_NONE_Young Scientists Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China_; U24 AG041689_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40820167,10.1038/s41598-025-12290-2,40820167,0,,

Here we introduce a next-generation digital microfluidics (DMF) electroporation platform that enables high-throughput, low-input genome engineering using discrete droplets manipulated on a planar electrode array. The system supports 48 independently programmable reaction sites and integrates seamlessly with laboratory automation, allowing efficient delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs and mRNA cargo into as few as 3,000 primary human cells per condition. The platform was validated across diverse primary human cell types and cargo modalities, demonstrating efficient delivery of various cargo, with high rates of transfection, gene knockout via non-homologous end joining, and precise knock-in through homology-directed repair. To showcase its utility in functional genomics, we applied the platform to an arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen in chronically stimulated human CD4⁺ T cells, identifying novel regulators of exhaustion, including epigenetic and transcriptional modulators. These findings establish our DMF-based electroporation platform as a powerful tool for miniaturized genome engineering in rare or precious cell populations and provide a scalable framework for high-content genetic screening in primary human cells.","Patel, Miti A; Boribong, Brittany P; Sinha, Hugo; Xiao, Bin; Xie, Keqiang; Vo, Philippe Q N; Chin, Andrew B; Ellouzi, Ayoub; Little, Samuel R; Shih, Steve; Wu, Hao; Muller, William J; Hirukawa, Alison","Full Circles Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.; DropGenie, Cambridge, MA, USA. alison@drop-genie.com.; Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada.; Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada.; DropGenie, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.; Department of Biology, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Humans, CRISPR-Cas Systems, Electroporation, Gene Editing, Microfluidics, CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, Miniaturization",2025,08,11,2025,08,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790054,10.1038/s41598-025-13532-z,40790054,0,,

However, the development of these predictive algorithms for mammalian systems has been hampered by limited datasets and high experimental costs. In this study, we present a Bayesian active learning framework designed to discover pairwise host gene knockdowns that effectively inhibit viral proliferation in an in vitro HIV-1 infection model. Our method leverages a biological knowledge graph as side information and employs a computationally efficient batch diversification approach. We evaluated this framework using a dataset of viral load measurements obtained from multi-day dual-gene depletion experiments, encompassing all possible pairwise knockdowns of over 350 host genes associated with HIV infection. We demonstrate that our framework rapidly identifies the most effective gene knockdown pairs for reducing viral load. Furthermore, we show that incorporating side information enhances performance during the early stages of active learning (low data regime), while our batch diversification strategy significantly boosts performance in later stages (high data regime). This framework is general and can be adapted to explore gene interactions in other contexts, such as synthetic lethality prediction and mapping epistatic effects across quantitative trait loci.","Soper, Braden; Lisicki, Michal; Silva, Mary; Cadena, Jose; Zhu, Haonan; Sundaram, Shivshankar; Ray, Priyadip; Drocco, Jeff","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA, 94550, USA. soper3@llnl.gov.; School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, N1G 2W1, Canada.; Vector Institute for AI, Schwartz Reisman Innovation Campus, Toronto, ON, M5G 0C6, Canada.; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA, 94550, USA.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Bayes Theorem, Humans, HIV-1, HIV Infections, Viral Load, Algorithms, Epistasis, Genetic, Computational Biology, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Computer Simulation",2025,08,25,2025,08,29,LDRD 23-SI-005_NONE_Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40854903,10.1038/s41598-025-13972-7,40854903,0,0,NONE
40790321,Preliminary evaluation of ShallowHRD performance compared to HRDetect in familial breast cancer tumors.,"Determining the Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)-status of a malignant tumor is central in predicting patient response to specific treatments. Therefore, precise and cost-effective tools are needed for clinical implementation. HRDetect is widely regarded as a golden standard for determining HRD-status. In contrast, ShallowHRD is a simpler algorithm. However, it offers a more economical alternative optimized for Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded tissue (FFPE) and potentially useful for most breast cancer patients. Data from shallow whole-genome sequencing (1-5X) on FFPE tissue and whole-genome sequencing (50X, and additionally downscaled to 5X) on fresh frozen tissue from 19 patients were analyzed using ShallowHRD and compared to the HRD-status attained by HRDetect using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Further, Spearman rank correlation was calculated to estimate the correlation between ShallowHRD and HRDetect scores, as well as between the three ShallowHRD datasets. The comparison of ShallowHRD to HRDetect displayed a significant specificity (85.7-100%) and sensitivity (80%) in all data groups. The ROC curve analyses illustrated that ShallowHRD displayed an area under the curve statistically similar to what was previously reported for HRDetect in all three data sets. The Spearman correlation also indicated significant correlation between ShallowHRD and HRDetect scores for the three datasets (HRDetect vs. FFPE (1-5X) (ρ = 0.68, p = 0.0013), Fresh Frozen (5X) (ρ = 0.58, p = 0.0086), and Fresh Frozen (50X) (ρ = 0.50, p = 0.029)). The ShallowHRD analysis was of good quality in all data groups, and the ShallowHRD scores were similar across data groups. One sample was incorrectly labeled as HRD-negative by ShallowHRD, but it contained one variant of unknown significance (VUS) in RAD51D, requiring further investigation. HRD-status from ShallowHRD correlated well with HRDetect output in this preliminary study, potentially making ShallowHRD an accurate, efficient, and more economical alternative for clinical use. However, further examination and validation in larger cohorts are required.","Adel Jensen, Louise; Baekgaard, Caroline Hey; Larsen, Mie Bohnensack; Boonen, Susanne Eriksen; Bak Jylling, Anne Marie; Hikmat, Zainab; Hao, Qin; van Overeem Hansen, Thomas; Pedersen, Inge Søkilde; Larsen, Martin Jakob; Thomassen, Mads","Clinical Genome Center, Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

To explore in greater depth the genomic basis of palatal clefts, we designed and implemented the first single cell spatial RNA-sequencing study in a cleft palate model, utilizing the Pax9<sup>-/-</sup> murine model at multiple developmental timepoints, which exhibits a consistent cleft palate defect. Visium HD, an emerging platform for true single-cell resolution spatially resolved transcriptomics, was employed using custom bins of 2 × 2 μm spatial gene expression data. Validation of spatial gene expression was then validated using custom designed Xenium In Situ mRNA spatial profiling and RNAscope Multiplex assays. Functional enrichment analysis revealed a palate cell-specific perturbation in Wnt signaling effector function in tandem with disrupted expression of extracellular matrix genes in developing mesenchyme. As a key step toward laying the framework for identifying key molecular targets these data can be used for translational studies aimed at developing effective therapies for human palatal clefts.","Piña, Jeremie Oliver; Raju, Resmi; Stipano, Evan; Myo, Aye Chan; Wang, Ziyi; Ono, Mitsuaki; Chattaraj, Parna; Furukawa, Masae; D'Souza, Rena N","Section on Craniofacial Genetic Disorders, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA.; Graduate School of Medicine Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA.; Section on Craniofacial Genetic Disorders, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA. jeremie.pina@nih.gov.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Animals, Cleft Palate, Extracellular Matrix, Mice, Wnt Signaling Pathway, Disease Models, Animal, Transcriptome, Single-Cell Analysis, Gene Expression Profiling, PAX9 Transcription Factor, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Mice, Knockout, Palate",2025,08,13,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40804270,10.1038/s41598-025-14807-1,40804270,0,,
40796628,Genomic decoding of drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission in Thailand over three decades.,"Thailand has a high burden of tuberculosis, with control efforts hindered by drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The increasing use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Mtb offers valuable insights for clinical management and public health surveillance. WGS can be used to profile drug resistance, identify circulating sub-lineages, and trace transmission pathways or outbreaks. We analysed WGS data from 2,005 Mtb isolates collected across Thailand from 1994-2020, including 816 retrieved and 1,189 newly sequenced samples, with most isolates being multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB). Most isolates are lineage two strains (78·3%), primarily the Beijing sub-lineage (L2.2.1). Drug resistance profiling revealed substantial isoniazid and rifampicin resistance, and 67·3% classified as MDR-TB. Phenotypic and genotypic drug susceptibility testing showed high concordance (91·1%). Clustering analysis identified 206 transmission clades (maximum size 288), predominantly with MDR-TB, especially in Central and Northeastern regions. One cluster (n = 22) contains the ddn Gly81Ser mutation, linked to delamanid resistance, with some members pre-dating drug roll-out. In the largest cluster (n = 288), containing isolates spanning two decades, we applied transmission reconstruction methods to estimate a mutation rate of 1·1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> substitutions per site per year. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of WGS in uncovering TB transmission and drug resistance, offering key data to inform better control strategies in Thailand and elsewhere.","Thawong, Naphatcha; Srilohasin, Prapaporn; Phelan, Jody E; Phornsiricharoenphant, Worawich; Tongsima, Sissades; Suriyaphol, Prapat; Prammananan, Therdsak; Faksri, Kiatichai; Sawaengdee, Waritta; Wang, Linfeng; Hinthong, Woranich; Hibberd, Martin L; Campino, Susana; Wattanapokayakit, Sukanya; Mahasirimongkol, Surakameth; Chaiprasert, Angkana; Clark, Taane G","Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK. taane.clark@lshtm.ac.uk.; Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.; Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7HT, UK. taane.clark@lshtm.ac.uk.; Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.

40890415,Emergence of the zoonotic bacterium Necropsobacter rosorum in nutria Myocastor coypus with implications for wildlife and human health.,"The nutria (Myocastor coypus), a semi-aquatic rodent native to South America, poses significant ecological and agricultural threats as an invasive species in France, where it continues to proliferate despite sustained control efforts. A fatal case of pneumonia in a nutria from Marseille (France) prompted a microbiological investigation that led to the isolation, taxonomic classification, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of Necropsobacter rosorum. Whole-genome sequencing of the N. rosorum strain RG01 revealed a genome size of 2,505,657 base pairs and 2303 predicted open reading frames, showing high similarity to other publicly available N. rosorum genomes. Comparative pan-genomic analysis indicated a high level of genomic conservation among N. rosorum strains. The presence of putative virulence factors and a CRISPR-Cas system suggests both pathogenic potential and adaptive defense mechanisms against bacteriophage predation. This study also explored the genetic epidemiology of members of the Pasteurellaceae family, highlighting a considerable overlap between species infecting animals and humans. Among the 408,387 sequence records retrieved from GenBank, 62.1% were deemed suitable for genomic epidemiological analysis. Notably, N. rosorum was underrepresented, with only 13 entries spanning nine countries and three host types, revealing critical gaps in current surveillance and research. Collectively, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the microbiology and epidemiology of N. rosorum and Pasteurellaceae-associated infections, and underscore the importance of integrated, genomics-informed approaches for the monitoring, control, and prevention of zoonotic diseases.","Laidoudi, Younes; Davoust, Bernard; Lepidi, Hubert; Levasseur, Anthony","Aix Marseille Université (AMU), UMR D257 RITMES, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Marseille (APHM), Service de Santé des Armées (SSA), Marseille, France. anthony.levasseur@univ-amu.fr.; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France. anthony.levasseur@univ-amu.fr.; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.; Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France. anthony.levasseur@univ-amu.fr.; Aix Marseille Université (AMU), UMR D257 RITMES, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Marseille (APHM), Service de Santé des Armées (SSA), Marseille, France.; Laboratoire anatomopathologie, Hôpital de La Timone, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Marseille (APHM), Marseille, France.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Animals, Humans, Phylogeny, Genome, Bacterial, France, Pasteurellaceae, Animals, Wild, Zoonoses, Whole Genome Sequencing, Rodentia, Bacterial Zoonoses",2025,09,01,2025,09,04,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40890415,10.1038/s41598-025-15792-1,40890415,0,0,NONE
40849341,The RASAL2 variant promotes aberrant RAS signaling and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer.,"Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies are essential for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, however, resistance remains problematic in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type patients. RAS protein activator-like 2 (RASAL2) regulates RAS signaling by catalyzing the conversion of RAS. This study investigates the pathogenicity of the germline RASAL2 c.2423 A > G variant, identified in a high-risk family, and its potential role in CRC progression and therapy resistance. Population analysis reveals its rarity in East Asians (0.01%) but an increased prevalence in Taiwanese CRC patients (1.63%). Functional studies demonstrate that RASAL2 c.2423 A > G enhances RAS signaling, causing sustained ERK phosphorylation and increased CRC cell proliferation. Additionally, RASAL2-mutant cells require higher doses of cetuximab for ERK suppression and growth inhibition, indicating resistance to anti-EGFR therapy via abnormal RAS activation. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria, the variant is likely pathogenic. Our study highlights RASAL2 c.2423 A > G as a potential biomarker for CRC risk and therapy response.","Yeh, Yu-Min; Hsu, Yi-Hsuan; Huang, Yi-Ting; Lin, Peng-Chan; Hsu, Ya-Ting; Wu, Pei-Ying; Shen, Meng-Ru","Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan. mrshen@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. mrshen@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Department of Genomic Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. mrshen@mail.ncku.edu.tw.; Department of Oncology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Humans, Colorectal Neoplasms, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, ErbB Receptors, Cetuximab, Signal Transduction, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, ras Proteins, Female, Male, GTPase-Activating Proteins, Middle Aged",2025,08,23,2025,08,27,MOHW-114-TDU-B-221-144005_NONE_Ministry of Health and Welfare_; 113-2640-B-006-004_NONE_National Science and Technology Council_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40849341,10.1038/s41598-025-16325-6,40849341,0,0,NONE
40858791,The bacterial community of the freshwater bryozoan Cristatella Mucedo and its secondary metabolites production potential.,"While marine bryozoans were shown to be a promising source of bioactive compounds with the potential to be developed into drugs, their freshwater counterparts remain understudied. Considering that bioactive compounds isolated from bryozoans may originate from bacterial communities associated with the hosts, we explored the bacterial community of the freshwater bryozoan Cristatella mucedo using genomics and metabolomics. 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the bacterial community associated with C. mucedo showed a considerable overlap with communities from surrounding water and sediment. Using different isolation approaches we retrieved a diverse collection of bacterial strains representing 26 genera, including a potentially new one. Genome sequencing and analyses of representative isolates of each genus revealed considerable potential for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The secondary metabolomes of both mono- and co-cultures of selected isolates and enriched bryozoan-derived communities were investigated, allowing the identification of several known and potentially novel secondary metabolites. This work provides important information regarding the composition of the bacterial community associated with C. mucedo and sets the stage for its further exploration and exploitation for drug discovery.","Tocino-Márquez, Inmaculada; Zehl, Martin; Séneca, Joana; Pjevac, Petra; Felkl, Manuel; Becker, Christian F W; Loy, Alexander; Rattei, Thomas; Ostrovsky, Andrew N; Zotchev, Sergey B","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Microbial Ecology, Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science, University of Vienna, 1030, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Invertebrate Zoology, Faculty of Biology, Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia, 199034.; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria. sergey.zotchev@univie.ac.at.; Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.; Doctoral School in Microbiology and Environmental Science, University of Vienna, 1030, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Palaeontology, Faculty of Earth Sciences, Geography and Astronomy, University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.; Division of Computational Systems Biology, Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science, University of Vienna, 1030, Vienna, Austria.; Joint Microbiome Facility of the Medical University of Vienna, University of Vienna, 1030, Vienna, Austria.",Scientific reports,Sci Rep,"Bryozoa, Animals, Secondary Metabolism, Bacteria, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Fresh Water, Microbiota, Metabolomics, Phylogeny, Metabolome",2025,08,26,2025,08,29,MetaBac Research Platform_NONE_Universität Wien_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40858791,10.1038/s41598-025-17084-0,40858791,0,0,NONE
40897921,Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing and artificial intelligence for multitargeted drug design for combating resistance in liver cancer.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous liver cancer with restricted therapy selections and poor diagnosis. Although there have been great advances in genomics, the molecular mechanisms essential to HCC progression are not yet fully implicit, particularly at the single-cell stage. This research utilized single-cell RNA sequencing technology to evaluate transcriptional heterogeneity, immune cell infiltration, and potential therapeutic targets in HCC. A detailed bioinformatics pipeline used in the experiment included quality control, feature selection, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), clustering, differential gene expression, pseudotime trajectory inference, and immune cell profiling with GSEA and survival analysis examining potential biomarkers of survival. Key findings include the identification of 1178 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with macrophage infiltration contributing to immune evasion. Notably, APOE and ALB are linked to a better prognosis, while XIST and FTL are associated with poor survival. The potential drug candidates include IGMESINE in the case of SERPINA1 and PKR-A/MITZ for APOA2 in the gene-drug interaction analysis. Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to predict drug-gene interactions and rank potential therapeutic candidates. The model shows robust predictive performance (R²: 0.9867, MSE: 0.0581) and identifies important drug candidates, such as Gadobenate Dimeglumine and Fluvastatin, and describes repurposing opportunities in network analysis, enhancing computational drug discovery for novel treatments. This research sheds new light on HCC tumor evolution, immune suppression, and the potential drug target based on the viewpoint of the importance of single-cell approaches in liver cancer research.","Wang, Houhong; Yang, Youyuan; Zhang, Junfeng; Chen, Wenli; Dai, Jingyou; Li, Changquan; Li, Qing","Department of Radiology, General Hospital of Western Theather Command of PLA, Chengdu, China.; Department of General Surgery, The Affiliated first Hospital of fuyang Normal University, Fuyang Normal University, Fuyang, Anhui Province, China.; Shapingba Hospital affiliated to Chongqing University (Shapingba District People's Hospital of Chongqing), Shapingba District, Chongqing, China. likunze88824@126.com.; Department of General Surgery, The Affiliated Bozhou Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Bozhou, Anhui Province, China.",NPJ precision oncology,NPJ Precis Oncol,,2025,09,02,2025,09,15,2023AH050658_NONE_Key Projects of Anhui Provincial Department of Education_; 2023BYZD202_NONE_Bengbu Medical University Research Program_; BY2022015_NONE_Anhui Medical University Doctoral Research Fund_; BZWJ2023A004_NONE_Bozhou Municipal Health Commission Subjects_; BZZD2024006_NONE_Bozhou Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40897921,10.1038/s41698-025-00952-3,40897921,0,0,NONE

40804293,Telomere-to-telomere genome assembly uncovers Wolbachia-driven recurrent male bottleneck effect and selection in a sawfly.,"Wolbachia, a widespread endosymbiotic bacterium, profoundly impacts insect hosts by distorting reproduction and population dynamics. Despite extensive laboratory research, its long-term effects on host evolution in nature remain poorly understood, especially the genomic consequences linked to disruptions in sex determination and reproductive processes. We present the first telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly of the sawfly Analcellicampa danfengensis and the complete genome of its symbiotic Wolbachia. Comparative population genomics across six Analcellicampa species revealed that Wolbachia-infected populations show starkly different demographic signals. While uninfected populations show similar demographic signals for both sexes, infected populations exhibit a lower apparent effective population size (Ne) in males, which may reflect a recurrent male bottleneck effect driven by Wolbachia-induced male scarcity. Genomic scans identified positively selected genes associated with reproductive functions, sensory perception, neural development, and longevity, suggesting that Wolbachia likely manipulates critical host pathways to promote its transmission. These findings provide direct genomic insights into Wolbachia as an evolutionary force, highlighting specific host genes and regions under selection resulting from these altered evolutionary dynamics. This work provides deeper insights into host-endosymbiont coevolution and has important implications for evolutionary theory and pest management strategies.","Zhang, Mingpeng; Zhai, Ruoyu; Niu, Gengyun; Chen, Jiaqi; Tan, Beibei; Wu, Duo; Meng, Guanliang; Wei, Meicai","College of Life Sciences, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China. weim@jxnu.edu.cn.; Kindstar Global Precision Medicine Institute, Wuhan, China.; College of Life Sciences, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; College of Life Sciences, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China. mingpengzhang@jxnu.edu.cn.; Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig, LIB, Bonn, Germany.",Communications biology,Commun Biol,"Wolbachia, Animals, Male, Telomere, Symbiosis, Female, Selection, Genetic, Genome, Bacterial",2025,08,13,2025,08,26,20232BAB215017_NONE_Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (Jiangxi Province Natural Science Foundation)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40804293,10.1038/s42003-025-08629-0,40804293,1,,[40804293]

However, how resistance alleles arise and spread across field populations remains largely understood. Here, we study the evolutionary trajectories of resistance alleles in Tetranychus urticae, a rapidly evolving pest. We sequence the genomes of 258 T. urticae females collected from China. Combined with global reference genomic data, we examine the evolutionary origin(s) of 18 mutations across 10 target-site genes and analyze the global population genetic structure using genome-wide SNPs. Our findings reveal a striking prevalence of multiple independent origins of resistance mutations, with only two of 18 mutations showing an apparent single origin. Population structure and haplotype analyses point to an important role of gene flow in the spread of resistance alleles. Selection analyses reveal pesticide-driven sweeps affecting genetic diversity.

The beauty of comparative biology is that it discovers adaptations that evolved outside of the protected laboratory environment, shaped by natural selection under real-world pressures. In this Review, we outline key approaches in comparative biology of aging studies, including the study of public mechanisms, which are shared between species, and private mechanisms, which are species-specific. Additionally, we present insights gained through high-throughput omics technologies-including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics-and illustrate how these findings advance our understanding of how to ameliorate the hallmarks of aging, enhance cancer resistance and improve regeneration, with a focus on mammals.

40823340,Proteogenomic signature of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia risk in individuals with major depressive disorder.,"The mechanisms linking a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are not fully understood. Using the UK Biobank, we evaluated the biological mechanisms linking both conditions. In participants without history of MDD, 493 proteins were significantly associated with the risk of ADRD. In contrast, in participants with a history of MDD at baseline, a smaller set of 6 proteins were significantly associated ADRD risk (NfL, GFAP, PSG1. VGF, GET3, and HPGDS), with GET3 being specifically associated with ADRD risk in the latter group. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis ahowed that the APOE and IL-10 receptor subunit B genes were causally linked to incident ADRD. Finally, we developed a Proteomic Risk Score (PrRS<sub>MDD-ADRD</sub>), which showed strong discriminative power (C-statistic = 0.84) to identify participants with MDD who developed ADRD upon follow-up. Here we show that plasma proteins associated with inflammation and amyloid-β metabolism are causally linked to a higher ADRD risk in individuals with MDD. Moreover, the PrRS<sub>MDD-ADRD</sub> can be useful to identify individuals with the highest risk of developing ADRD in a highly vulnerable population.","Diniz, Breno Satler; Chen, Zhiduo; Steffens, David C; Pilling, Luke; Nikolova, Yuliya; Clifford, Kevan; Fortinsky, Richard H; Kuchel, George A; Kuo, Chia-Ling","Department of Psychiatry, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT, USA.; The Cato T.

40790356,Tau uptake by human neurons depends on receptor LRP1 and kinase LRRK2.,"Extracellular release and uptake of pathogenic forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Defining the cellular mechanisms and pathways for tau entry to human neurons is essential to understanding tauopathy pathogenesis and enabling the rational design of disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, whole-genome, loss-of-function CRISPR screens in human iPSC-derived excitatory neurons, the major neuronal cell type affected in these diseases, provide insights into the different cellular pathways for uptake of extracellular monomeric and fibrillar tau. Monomeric and fibrillar tau are both taken up by human neurons by receptor-mediated endocytosis, but involve different routes of entry at the neuronal surface: the low-density lipoprotein LRP1 is the primary receptor for monomeric tau, but contributes less to fibrillar tau entry. Similarly, endocytosis of monomeric tau is dependent on the familial Parkinson's disease gene LRRK2, but not required for endocytosis of fibrillar tau. These findings implicate LRP1 and LRRK2 in the pathogenesis of tauopathies and Parkinson's disease, and identify LRRK2 as a potential therapeutic target for altering progression of these diseases.","Evans, Lewis D; Strano, Alessio; Tuck, Eleanor; Campbell, Ashley; Smith, James; Hung, Christy; Behr, Tiana S; Ghetti, Bernardino; Ryskeldi-Falcon, Benjamin; Karakoc, Emre; Iorio, Francesco; Reith, Alastair; Bassett, Andrew R; Livesey, Frederick J","UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer, Zayed Centre for Research into Rare Disease in Children, London, WC1N 1DZ, UK. rick@talisman-therapeutics.com.; Department of Neuroscience, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR.; Talisman Therapeutics, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, CB22 3AT, UK.; Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.; Open Targets, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK.; Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland.; Talisman Therapeutics, Babraham Research Campus, Cambridge, CB22 3AT, UK. rick@talisman-therapeutics.com.; UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer, Zayed Centre for Research into Rare Disease in Children, London, WC1N 1DZ, UK.; Novel Human Genetics Research Unit, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals R&D, Stevenage, UK.; MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, CB2 0QH, UK.; Human Technopole, 20157, Milano, Italy.",The EMBO journal,EMBO J,"Humans, Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1, Neurons, tau Proteins, Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2, Endocytosis, Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells, Parkinson Disease, Tauopathies",2025,08,11,2025,09,18,Stem Cell Research Centre_NONE_Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK)_; WT101052MA_NONE_Wellcome Trust (WT)_; N/A_NONE_NIHR | NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre (BRC)_; Stem Cell Professorship_NONE_Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity (GOSH)_; OTAR036_NONE_OpenTargets_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790356,10.1038/s44318-025-00514-0,40790356,0,,

However, the underlying separation mechanism facilitated by their unique hydrogen-bond networks has not yet been fully understood. In this work, a comprehensive understanding of the separation mechanisms was achieved through an iterative data-driven inverse engineering approach established upon a hypothetical HOF database possessing nearly 110 000 structures created by a materials genomics method. Leveraging a simple yet universal feature extracted from hydrogen bonding information with unambiguous physical meanings, the entire design space was exploited to rapidly identify the optimization route towards novel HOF structures with superior Xe/Kr separation performance (selectivity > 10<sup>3</sup>).

40829017,Mitochondrial genome copy number variation across tissues in mice and humans.,"The mammalian mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is multicopy and its copy number (mtCN) varies widely across tissues, in development and in disease. Here, we systematically catalog this variation by assaying mtCN in 52 human tissues across 952 donors (10,499 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project) and 20 murine tissues using qPCR, capturing 50- and 200-fold variation, respectively. We also estimate per cell mtCN across 173 human cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia using whole-genome sequencing data and observe >50-fold variation. We then leverage the vast amount of genomics data available for these repositories to credential our resource and uncover mtDNA-related biology. Using already existing proteomics data, we show that variation in mtCN can be predicted by variation in TFAM, histone, and mitochondrial ribosome protein abundance. We also integrate mtCN estimates with the CRISPR gene dependency measurements to find that cell lines with high mtCN are resistant to loss of GPX4, a glutathione phospholipid hydroperoxidase. Our resource captures variation in mtCN across mammalian tissues and should be broadly useful to the research community.","Rath, Sneha P; Gupta, Rahul; Todres, Ellen; Wang, Hong; Jourdain, Alexis A; Ardlie, Kristin G; Calvo, Sarah E; Mootha, Vamsi K","Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142.; Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Lausanne, Epalinges 1066, Switzerland.; HHMI, Boston, MA 02114.; Department of Systems Biology and Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Humans, Animals, DNA Copy Number Variations, Mice, Genome, Mitochondrial, DNA, Mitochondrial, Mitochondria, Mitochondrial Proteins, Whole Genome Sequencing, Genomics",2024,08,06,2025,08,26,5K00CA212468-05_NONE_HHS | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)_; K00 CA212468_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; Investigator Award_NONE_JPB Foundation (JPBF)_; K99 GM145848_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; HHMI Investigator Award_NONE_Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)_; 1K99GM145848-01A1_NONE_HHS | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40829017,10.1073/pnas.2402291121,40829017,3,,"[40307428, 39345381, 39713397]"
40833417,Pervasive and recurrent hybridization prevents inbreeding in Europe's most threatened seabird.,"Hybridization is a double-edged sword: While it can erode distinct evolutionary lineages, it can also introduce genetic diversity and adaptive potential into dwindling populations. In the Critically Endangered Balearic shearwater (<i>Puffinus mauretanicus</i>), this dilemma is exacerbated by a limited understanding of the extent and consequences of hybridization with the Yelkouan shearwater (<i>Puffinus yelkouan</i>). This knowledge gap has limited the scope of science-based conservation strategies to avoid the Balearic shearwater's imminent extinction. Here, we investigate shearwater hybridization dynamics and their effect on genome-wide diversity in the Balearic shearwater. Divergence dating, demographic modeling, and admixture analyses suggest that these two poorly differentiated shearwater lineages have experienced recurrent episodes of divergence and widespread hybridization during glacial cycles. Selection scans reveal a 500 kb region hosting an adaptive haplotype that potentially underpins interspecific differences in migratory behavior and which has been repeatedly introgressed between the two taxa. Moreover, we show that interspecific gene flow has prevented increases in homozygosity and genetic load, and through forward simulations, we illustrate how it can buffer the negative effects of future population bottlenecks in the Balearic shearwater. Our findings illustrate how introgression can be crucial for maintaining genetic diversity in threatened taxa and highlight the need for considering the protection of hybridization in conservation plans.","Izquierdo-Arànega, Guillem; Cuevas-Caballé, Cristian; Giannelli, Francesco; Paris, Josephine R; Bourgeois, Karen; Trucchi, Emiliano; González-Solís, Jacob; Riutort, Marta; Obiol, Joan Ferrer; Rozas, Julio","Department of Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523.; Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, Marche Polytechnic University, Ancona 60131, Italy.; Aix Marseille Université, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Avignon Université, Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d'Ecologie marine et continentale, Bât.

40825128,Inbreeding reduces fitness in spatially structured populations of a threatened rattlesnake.,"Small and fragmented populations are at high risk of local extinction, in part because of elevated inbreeding and subsequent inbreeding depression. A major conservation priority is to identify the mechanisms and extent of inbreeding depression in small populations. The eastern massasauga (<i>Sistrurus catenatus</i>) rattlesnake is listed as Federally Threatened in the United States, having experienced significant habitat fragmentation and concomitant population declines over the past 200 years. Here, we use long-term monitoring of two wild populations of eastern massasaugas in Michigan to estimate the extent of inbreeding in each population, identify mechanisms that generate inbreeding, and test for the impact of inbreeding on fitness. Using targeted genomic data and spatial coordinates of capture locations from over 1000 individuals, we find evidence of inbreeding and link inbreeding to spatial kinship structure within populations, possibly driven by limited dispersal. We reconstruct multigenerational pedigrees for each population to measure reproductive output and use long-term capture-recapture data to estimate individual survival (i.e., the two major components of fitness). We find evidence of inbreeding depression in both fitness metrics. The 5% most inbred individuals are 13.5% less likely to have any surviving offspring and have 11.6% lower annual survival compared to all less inbred individuals. By combining genomics and long-term monitoring data, we are able to link the life history of eastern massasaugas to inbreeding and detect relationships between fitness and inbreeding. These insights provide important conservation context for future management and for understanding how spatial structure can generate inbreeding depression even at fine spatial scales.","Clark, Meaghan I; Hileman, Eric T; Moore, Jennifer A; Faust, Lisa J; Junge, Randall E; Reid, Brendan N; Bradke, Danielle R; Bradburd, Gideon S; Fitzpatrick, Sarah W","Alexander Center for Applied Population Biology, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, IL 60614.; Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602.; Department of Conservation Medicine, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, Powell, OH 43065.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95060.; W.K.

40901884,Inverse stable isotope probing-metabolomics (InverSIP) identifies an iron acquisition system in a methane-oxidizing bacterial community.,"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a target for near-term climate change mitigation. In many natural ecosystems, methane is sequestered by microbial communities, yet little is known about how constituents of methane-oxidizing communities interact with each other and their environment. This lack of mechanistic understanding is a common issue for many important microbial communities, but it is difficult to draw links between available sequencing information and the metabolites that govern community interactions. Here, we develop and apply a technique called inverse stable isotope probing-metabolomics (InverSIP) to bridge the gap between metagenomic and metabolomic information and functionally characterize interactions in a complex methane-oxidizing community. Using InverSIP, we link a highly transcribed biosynthetic gene cluster in the community with its secondary metabolite product: methylocystabactin, a triscatecholate siderophore not previously observed in nature. We find that production of methylocystabactin is widespread among methanotrophic alphaproteobacteria and that it can be used by another methanotroph in the community that does not produce this siderophore itself. Functional assays reveal that methylocystabactin supports methanotroph growth and the activity of the methane-oxidizing enzyme soluble methane monooxygenase under conditions where bioavailable iron is limited, establishing an important molecular link between methane-oxidation and the insoluble iron found in many natural environments. These findings contribute to a molecular-level understanding of these environmentally important bacterial communities and establish InverSIP as a broadly applicable genomics-guided strategy for characterizing metabolites in microbial ecosystems.","Robes, Jose Miguel D; Liebergesell, Tashi C E; Beals, Delaney G; Yu, Xinhui; Brazelton, William J; Puri, Aaron W","School of Biological Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.; Henry Eyring Center for Cell and Genome Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.; Department of Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Methane, Iron, Metabolomics, Oxidation-Reduction, Isotope Labeling, Microbiota, Bacteria, Siderophores, Multigene Family",2025,09,03,2025,09,18,2339190_NONE_National Science Foundation (NSF)_; T32 AI055434_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; LS-ECIAMEE-00006628_NONE_Simons Foundation (SF)_; R35 GM147018_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40901884,10.1073/pnas.2507323122,40901884,0,0,NONE
40916578,Omics-driven insights into the molecular pathways driving osteoarthritis pathogenesis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial, mechano-inflammatory joint disorder characterized by cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling. Despite its high prevalence and significant impact on quality of life, no disease-modifying treatments have been approved. In many other disease areas, advanced omics technologies are impacting the development of advanced therapies. In OA, omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have significantly increased our understanding of OA pathogenesis by uncovering molecular pathways driving disease progression. However, we have yet to see any tangible impact on the development of effective disease-modifying therapies. This review focuses on single- and multi-omics studies in OA, emphasizing their role in identifying molecular subtypes (endotypes) and therapeutic subtypes (theratypes). Multi-omics integration has revealed crosstalk between inflammatory, metabolic, and degradative processes, while spatial proteomics is beginning to provide insights into synovial tissue heterogeneity. However, challenges such as data complexity, lack of standardized frameworks, and limited translational validation hinder rapid progress. Future work will need to leverage artificial intelligence, single-cell, and spatial omics within longitudinal cohort studies. By addressing these challenges, omics-driven research holds promise for helping clinicians differentiating patients presenting with OA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) affecting the hands or knees, developing personalized OA therapies, and achieving true disease modification beyond symptomatic relief.","Welsing, Paco Mattheus Jacobus; El Bouhaddani, Said; Zhu, Lin; Nijhof, Nienke C; Mastbergen, Simon C; Wen, Chunyi; Bacardit, Jaume; Ruiz-Romero, Cristina; Blanco, Francisco J; Mobasheri, Ali","Faculté de Médecine, Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium.; Department of Chemistry, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, SAR.; Department of Joint Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Data science & Biostatistics, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Interdisciplinary Computing and Complex BioSystems (ICOS) Research Group, School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle, UK.; Grupo de Investigación de Reumatología (GIR), Unidad de Proteómica, INIBIC-Hospital Universitario A Coruña, A Coruña, Spain.; Grupo de Reumatología y Salud, Departamento de Fisioterapia y Medicina, Centro de investigaciones Avanzadas (CICA), Universidad de A Coruña, A Coruña, Spain.; Department of Regenerative Medicine, State Research Institute Centre for Innovative Medicine, Vilnius, Lithuania.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, SAR.; Research Unit of Health Sciences and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.",Connective tissue research,Connect Tissue Res,,2025,09,07,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916578,10.1080/03008207.2025.2541291,40916578,0,0,NONE

40828164,Wastewater surveillance for early pathogen detection in Asia.,"Wastewater surveillance (WS) has emerged as an important population-based surveillance tool for early pathogen detection to inform timely public health action. Despite global guidance to initiate WS programming in Asia, the priorities and needs in Asia remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment of WS efforts in Asia. An institutional survey recorded 89 separate projects among 45 institutions in 19 countries in Asia. Financing for WS was equally split between domestic and external resources. Most projects were research-oriented, with one-fifth embedded within national surveillance systems. Influents from urban wastewater treatment plants were the most common sampling sources identified, with either monthly or weekly sampling frequencies. Most efforts were single-pathogen focused, with SARS-CoV-2, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) bacteria, enterovirus, influenza and poliovirus being the top five pathogens assessed. Despite challenges including limited funding and government support, there has been substantial recent progress on the adoption of WS across Asia. Opportunities to enhance sustainability and scale will depend upon efforts to document public health use cases, support national planning and budgeting, develop tailored protocols and regional guidance, and advance innovative multi-pathogen approaches that leverage innovations including pathogen genomics to advance cost-efficient WS systems for public health impact.","Pang, Junxiong; Wong, Judith Chui Ching; Wulandari, Suci Melati; Tay, Martin; Karlsson, Erik Albert; Oktaria, Vicka; Nisar, Imran; Alam, Munirul; Murni, Indah Kartika; Amir, Afreenish; Ishtiaq, Farah; Tong, Zhang; Kitajima, Masaaki; Nolan, Monica; Mak, Sandy Tze-Minn; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Smith, Gavin James; de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Boucher, Yann Felix; Ng, Lee Ching; Pronyk, Paul Michael","Molecular Ecology and Metagenomic Laboratory, Infectious Diseases Division, icddr, b, Dhaka, Bangladesh.; Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Medical College, The Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.; Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore.; Research Center for Water Environment Technology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.; Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.; Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore.; Environmental Health Institute, National Environmental Agency, Singapore.; SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore.; Center for Child Health - Pediatric Research Office, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Population Health, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.; Tata Institute for Genetics and Society, Bengaluru, India.; Water Research Australia, Adelaide, Australia.; National Influenza Center and Regional H5 Reference Laboratory, Virology Unit, Institute Pasteur du Cambodge, Cambodia.; Public Health Laboratories Division, National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan.; Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.; Centre for Outbreak Preparedness, Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore.; The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.; School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.; Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.",International journal of environmental health research,Int J Environ Health Res,,2025,08,19,2025,09,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40828164,10.1080/09603123.2025.2544736,40828164,0,,

40920824,Multi-omics analyses reveal the regulation mechanisms of organic acid biosynthesis in newly isolated lactic acid bacteria with application in corn biomass fermentation.,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in industrial fermentation due to their versatile metabolic capabilities. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying organic acid biosynthesis in newly isolated <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> YC1-1-4B and <i>Lentilactobacillus buchneri</i> PC-C1 strains at two culture intervals and their applications in corn biomass fermentation. YC1-1-4B exhibited faster growth and higher organic acid production (29.18 ± 2.17 mg/L at 12h) compared to PC-C1. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed significant upregulation of <i>ldh</i> and <i>ackA</i> genes at 12h, enhancing lactate and acetate metabolism. In PC-C1, ribosome and RNA polymerase genes were upregulated at 12h, while YC1-1-4B showed activation of the pentose phosphate pathway at both 6h and 12h. Notably, YC1-1-4B highly expressed genes converting 6-phosphogluconolactone and succinyl CoA to organic acids at 12h. Both strains displayed <i>sucC</i> and <i>sucD</i> gene overlap at 12h, suggesting translational coupling. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results were strongly correlated. LAB fermentation reduced pH over time, with YC1-1-4B exhibiting a homofermentative profile and PC-C1 maintaining a heterofermentative metabolism, enhancing corn biomass stability through acetic acid production. The combined inoculation (PCYC) shifted fermentation from lactic acid to acetic acid dominance, enhancing corn biomass preservation and LAB proliferation. These findings link genomic regulation to practical fermentation applications.","Okoye, Charles Obinwanne; Jiang, Huifang; Chen, Xunfeng; Wang, Yongli; Wu, Yanfang; Gao, Lu; Jiang, Jianxiong","School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.; Biofuels Institute, School of Environment & Safety Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.; Department of Zoology & Environmental Biology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria.",Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,Prep Biochem Biotechnol,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40920824,10.1080/10826068.2025.2555312,40920824,0,0,NONE

40804795,Elucidating the impact of PFAS exposure on diabetes through integrated network toxicology.,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmental pollutants linked to various health concerns, including metabolic disorders like diabetes. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which PFAS exposure influences diabetes through network toxicology and functional genomics approaches. We utilized the GSE25724 diabetes-related dataset to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PFAS exposure using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Our methodologies included enrichment analyses, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network construction, immune cell infiltration analysis, molecular docking, and validation experiments on HepG2 cells. Our analysis identified 34 DEGs linked to both diabetes and PFAS exposure. Enrichment analysis indicated these genes' involvement in critical pathways such as adipocytokine signaling, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. ssGSEA revealed that inflammation-related pathways were significantly upregulated, while metabolic and stress response pathways were downregulated in the T2DM group. The PPI network pinpointed ATP2A2, INS, and NFE2L2 as key hub genes, which were validated to be significantly downregulated under PFAS exposure in HepG2 cells. The diagnostic potential of these genes was strong, with AUC values over 0.88. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed significantly altered immune profiles in the T2DM group. Molecular docking demonstrated stable binding between PFAS compounds and key genes, providing insights into potential molecular interactions. Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure disrupts crucial gene functions and biological pathways associated with diabetes, highlighting the significant impact of environmental toxicants on metabolic health. This underlines the need for further research into PFAS's role in diabetes pathophysiology.","Chen, Danyan","Departments of Endocrinology, Chongqing General Hospital, Chongqing, China.",Toxicology mechanisms and methods,Toxicol Mech Methods,,2025,08,13,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40804795,10.1080/15376516.2025.2544030,40804795,0,,
40817758,Description of bacterial RNA transcripts detected in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> - infected cells from peripheral human granulomas.,"<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) remains a global human health threat. However, understanding effects of the microbe on cellular interactions in infected tissue has been hindered by inability to discriminate between infected versus un-infected cells. We included the H37Rv Mtb reference genome when assembling scRNA seq libraries from fine needle aspirate samples of peripheral nodal TB patients. Using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger tool to align sequencing reads, we consistently detected bacterial small and large ribosomal subunit RNA sequences. We interpret Mtb reads associated with a cell's UMI and transcriptome to indicate infection of that individual host cell. This provides a new window into the status of infected cells in the context of the bystander cells in the infected tissue. We investigated these Mtb transcripts to explore their clinical utility. The Mtb transcripts showed frequent sequence variation from the reference genome, with greater than 90% of the <i>rrs</i> or <i>rrl</i> reads from many clinical samples having at least one sequence difference. The highly conserved nature of the <i>rrs</i> and <i>rrl</i> gene sequences limited the ability to assign bacterial lineage based solely transcriptome analysis. However, rapid improvements in sequencing depth may soon allow transcriptome analysis of infecting microbes and improved certainty regarding their lineage, drug resistance, and virulence factors.","Moos, Philip J; Carey, Allison F; Joseph, Jacklyn; Kialo, Stephanie; Norrie, Joe; Moyareke, Julie M; Amof, Anthony; Nogua, Hans; Lim, Albebson L; Barrows, Louis R","Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Coordinator of Pathology Services, Port Moresby General Hospital, Port Moresby Papua New Guinea.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.; Division of Pathology, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Papua New Guinea and Central Public Health Laboratory, Papua New Guinea National Department of Health, PMGH, Boroko, Papua New Guinea.",Virulence,Virulence,"Humans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, RNA, Bacterial, Granuloma, Tuberculosis, Gene Expression Profiling, Transcriptome, Genome, Bacterial",2025,08,25,2025,08,29,U01 TW008163_TW_FIC NIH HHS_United States; K08 AI139339_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; P30 CA042014_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40817758,10.1080/21505594.2025.2547326,40817758,1,,[40817758]

40814227,DeepGraphMut: a graph-based deep learning method for cancer prognosis using somatic mutation profile.,"Cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advances in genomics, identifying clinically relevant subtypes of cancer remains challenging due to its complex and heterogeneous nature. In this work, we propose DeepGraphMut (DGM), a novel graph-based deep-learning pipeline that integrates somatic mutation data with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. By employing a graph autoencoder with a graph attention layer and a node-level attention decoder, DGM generates patient-specific clinically relevant encodings for unsupervised and supervised tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DGM across 16 cancer types comprising of 7352 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Unsupervised clustering reveals distinct subtypes with significant survival differences in 11 cancer types. In supervised analysis using a Cox regression model, DGM demonstrates excellent performance in predicting survival outcomes, achieving a high concordance index (C-index) value in the range of 0.7 across most cancers, underscoring its robust predictive performance using only somatic mutation data. Furthermore, DGM outperforms its lightweight variant and network-based stratification methods in both unsupervised and supervised analyses. In summary, this study presents a promising approach for cancer subtype identification and prognosis, especially in resource-limited settings where multi-omics data may not be readily available. By leveraging the strengths of graph learning and network biology, DGM offers a valuable tool for advancing personalized medicine.","Jose, Aswin; Srivastava, Akansha; Ansari, Ariba; Vinod, Palakkad Krishnanunni","Centre for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics, IIIT Hyderabad, Prof. C R Rao Road, Gachibowli, Hyderabad 500032, India.",Briefings in bioinformatics,Brief Bioinform,"Deep Learning, Humans, Neoplasms, Mutation, Prognosis, Protein Interaction Maps, Computational Biology",2025,08,14,2025,08,25,"NONE_NONE_International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40814227,10.1093/bib/bbaf409,40814227,0,,

Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of AI, utilizes multi-layer neural network algorithms to analyze various types of data, mimicking the neural network architecture of the human brain. One of the most prominent features of DL is its end-to-end learning mechanism, which excels at automatic feature extraction and pattern recognition in data. As multi-omics technologies rapidly evolve, the volume of omics data from cancer samples has surged, presenting a significant challenge in managing this vast amount of information. Due to its strong data processing capabilities, DL is increasingly applied across a range of cancer research areas, such as early detection and screening, diagnosis, molecular subtype classification, discovery of biomarkers, and predicting patient prognosis and treatment responses. DL integrates high-dimensional data from fields such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, radiomics, and single-cell omics, enhancing our understanding of cancer development and advancing personalized treatment approaches. This paper reviews various DL models and their roles in analyzing complex data patterns, providing a review of DL applications in cancer multi-omics analysis research and emphasizing its potential in early detection, diagnosis, classification, and prognosis prediction.

40874819,BBANsh: a deep learning architecture based on BERT and bilinear attention networks to identify potent shRNA.,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a technique for precisely silencing the expression of specific genes by means of small RNA molecules and is essential in functional genomics. Among the commonly used RNAi molecules, short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) exhibit advantages over small interfering RNAs, including longer half-life, comparable silencing efficiency, fewer off-target effects, and greater safety. However, traditional screening of potent shRNAs is costly and time-consuming. Advances in big data and artificial intelligence have enabled computational methods to significantly accelerate shRNA design and prediction. In this study, we propose BBANsh, a new shRNA prediction model based on bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and bilinear attention network (BAN). We comprehensively evaluate the performance of BBANsh against traditional feature-based models, various feature fusion methods, and existing shRNA prediction models. The BBANsh has achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.951 on five-cross validation and a prediction accuracy of 0.896 on a new external validation set, highlighting its superior predictive performance. Ablation experiments validate the significant contributions of BERT and BAN to model performance. The visualization of internal feature representations intuitively demonstrates the effectiveness of the feature fusion strategy of BBANsh. Furthermore, the attentional analysis reveals that nucleotides near the 5' end have the greatest impact on model predictions, highlighting sequence characteristics of potent shRNAs. Overall, BBANsh provides an efficient and reliable tool for shRNA prediction, which can offer valuable support for researchers in the precise selection and design of shRNA.","Chen, Yuanting; Chen, Long; Yu, Xinxin; Li, Weihua; Tang, Yun; Liu, Guixia","Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Optogenetic Techniques for Cell Metabolism, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China.",Briefings in bioinformatics,Brief Bioinform,"Deep Learning, RNA, Small Interfering, RNA Interference, Humans, Computational Biology, Algorithms, Neural Networks, Computer",2025,08,28,2025,08,31,NONE_NONE_Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Optogenetic Techniques for Cell Metabolism (Shanghai Municipal Education Commission)_; U23A20530_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 82273858_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40874819,10.1093/bib/bbaf443,,,,
40905375,Mapping cancer heterogeneity: a consensus network approach to subtypes and pathways.,"We introduce consensus MSClustering, an unsupervised hierarchical network approach that integrates multi-omics data to identify molecular subtypes and conserved pathways across diverse cancers. Using a novel heterogeneity index, we selected 167 key genes with functionally coherent roles validated through Gene Ontology analysis. Applied to 2439 tumors spanning 10 cancer types-and successfully extended to 2675 tumors (12 types) including cases with incomplete molecular data-MSClustering demonstrated: (i) precise classification of major cancer types and breast cancer molecular subtypes; (ii) discovery of novel pan-cancer squamous metaplastic signatures; (iii) exceptional prognostic stratification (log-rank P = 2.3 × 10-46); and (iv) superior performance over existing methods (COCA/SNF) in classification accuracy, cluster robustness, and computational efficiency. The method's multi-scale architecture uniquely resolves breast cancer heterogeneity across biological resolution levels. Pathway analysis further revealed four key oncogenic programs-proteoglycan signaling, chromosomal stability, VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, and drug metabolism-along with disruptions in immune and digestive system functions. This integrative framework marks a significant advancement in cancer genomics by enabling more refined molecular classification, enhanced prognostic insights, and deeper understanding of disease mechanisms. These results highlight the potential of MSClustering to inform the development of clinically relevant biomarkers and support more personalized strategies in precision oncology.","Hu, Geng-Ming; Chen, Hsin-Wei; Chen, Chi-Ming","Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University, 88 Sec.4 Ting-Chou Rd., Taipei 116, Taiwan.",Briefings in bioinformatics,Brief Bioinform,"Humans, Neoplasms, Biomarkers, Tumor, Computational Biology, Female, Genetic Heterogeneity, Prognosis, Gene Regulatory Networks, Breast Neoplasms, Signal Transduction, Gene Expression Profiling, Cluster Analysis, Genomics",2025,09,04,2025,09,07,NSTC 113-2221-E-003-015_NONE_National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan_; NSTC 114-2221-E-003-019_NONE_National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905375,10.1093/bib/bbaf452,40905375,0,0,NONE
40861392,Statistical relationships across epigenomes using large-scale hierarchical clustering.,"Recent advances in genomics and sequencing platforms have revolutionized our ability to create immense data sets, particularly for studying epigenetic regulation of gene expression. However, the avalanche of epigenomic data is difficult to parse for biological interpretation given nonlinear complex patterns and relationships. This attractive challenge in epigenomic data lends itself to machine learning for discerning infectivity and susceptibility. In this study, we explore over 3000 epigenomes of uninfected individuals and provide a framework to characterize the relationships among epigenetic modifiers, their modifiers, genetic loci, and specific immune cell types across all chromosomes using hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering of epigenomic data revealed consistent epigenetic patterns across chromosomes, demonstrating that variation due to epigenetic modifiers is greater than variation between cell types. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses indicated significant enrichment of genes involved in chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, immune responses, and the regulation of microRNAs and snoRNAs. Epigenetic modifiers frequently formed biologically relevant clusters, including the cohesin complex, RNA Polymerase II transcription factors, and PRC2 complex members. These clustering behaviors remained consistent across all chromosomes, supported by entropy analysis and high Adjusted Rand Index scores, indicating robust cross-chromosomal similarity. Co-occurrence analysis further revealed specific sets of modifiers that consistently appeared together within clusters, reflecting shared biological functions and interactions. Validation using another dataset confirmed the reproducibility of these clustering patterns and modifier co-occurrence relationships, underscoring the reliability and generalizability of the methodology.

40824067,The Impact of Tokenizer Selection in Genomic Language Models.,"Genomic language models have recently emerged as a new method to decode, interpret, and generate genetic sequences. Existing genomic language models have utilized various tokenization methods, including character tokenization, overlapping and non-overlapping k-mer tokenization, and byte-pair encoding, a method widely used in natural language models. Genomic sequences differ from natural language because of their low character variability, complex and overlapping features, and inconsistent directionality. These features make sub-word tokenization in genomic language models significantly different from both traditional language models and protein language models. This study explores the impact of tokenization in genomic language models by evaluating their downstream performance on forty-four classification fine-tuning tasks. We also perform a direct comparison of byte pair encoding and character tokenization in Mamba, a state-space model. Our results indicate that character tokenization outperforms sub-word tokenization methods on tasks that rely on nucleotide level resolution, such as splice site prediction and promoter detection. While byte-pair tokenization had stronger performance on the SARS-CoV-2 variant classification task, we observed limited statistically significant differences between tokenization methods on the remaining downstream tasks.

Borzoi, which models over ten thousand genomic assays including RNA-seq coverage from over half a megabase of sequence context alone promises to become an important foundation model in regulatory genomics, both for massively annotating variants and for further model development. However, the currently used relative positional encodings limit Borzoi's computational efficiency. We present Flashzoi, an enhanced Borzoi model that leverages rotary positional encodings and FlashAttention-2.

40889281,scPOEM: Robust Co-embedding of Peaks and Genes Revealing Peak-Gene Regulation.,"Identifying regulatory elements in various chromosomal regions that influence gene expression is a fundamental challenge in epigenomics, with profound implications for understanding gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The advent of paired single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequencing has created unprecedented opportunities to address this challenge by enabling simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution. However, the inherent signals between them are weak due to the highly sparse and noisy nature of data. This paper proposes scPOEM (single-cell meta-Path based Omics EMbedding), a novel embedding method that jointly projects chromatin accessibility peaks and expressed genes into a shared low-dimensional space. By integrating the relationships among peak-peak, peak-gene, and gene-gene interactions, scPOEM assigns closer representations in the embedding space to related peak-gene pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that scPOEM generates stable representations of peaks and genes, outperforms existing methods in recovering biologically meaningful peak-gene regulatory relationships, and enables new insights in subgroup and differential analysis of gene regulation. These results highlight its potential to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms and enhance the understanding of transcriptional regulation at single-cell resolution.

The toxicity of peptides is one of the major challenges in peptide drug therapy. With the abundance of therapeutic peptides generated in the post-genomics era, it is a challenge to promptly identify toxicity peptides using computational methods. Although several efforts have been made, few algorithms are designed to identify whether a query peptide exhibits toxicity. Considering the varied levels of biological activities, the toxicity peptides should be further classified into multi-functional peptides. This study introduces a two-level predictor, ToxPre-2L, developed using the multi-view tensor learning and latent semantic learning framework. The proposed method utilized multi-label learning with feature induced labels to avoid the redundancy of information from each view. Then the multi-view tensor learning was employed to establish the latent semantic information among different views, while low-rank constraint learning was leveraged to exploit the correlation information among multi-labels. Finally, we constructed an updated toxicity peptide benchmark dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that ToxPre-2L achieves a better performance than alternative computational methods in the prediction of toxicity peptides and their multi-functional types.

40796214,Results of the 9th Scientific Workshop of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO): Artificial Intelligence in medical management and precision medicine.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in various fields of medicine, including Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). This systematic review, conducted as part of the ECCO 9th Scientific Workshop on AI in IBD, explores AI applications in multiomic precision medicine, large language models (LLMs) for textual tasks and utilisation of wearable and remote care technologies. A comprehensive systematic analysis of the literature was undertaken, emphasising three topics: multiomic predictive models in IBD; natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs for clinical practice, research and patient communication; and the role of remote monitoring and wearable devices. Key areas of promise include the implementation of NLP and LLMs for case identification and differentiation, tracking disease activity, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance and patient support. Multiomic approaches, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics, show potential for developing more accurate diagnostic and risk prediction models and improving treatment response prediction and detection of actionable drug targets for future therapeutics. Wearables and remote monitoring technologies can transform IBD management from episodic assessments to continuous less biased tracking of patient-reported outcomes and physiological biomarkers. While AI and multiomic approaches hold substantial promise for advancing IBD management and research, further refinement is necessary to ensure content validity and address safety concerns, thereby allowing integration of AI into clinical workflows and safeguarding of data privacy.

40827730,"LIPA, a risk locus for coronary artery disease: decoding the variant-to-function relationship.","Translating human genomic discoveries into mechanistic insights requires linking genetic variations to candidate genes and their causal functional phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies have consistently identified LIPA (lipase A, lysosomal acid type) as a risk locus for coronary artery disease, with previous analyses prioritising LIPA as a likely causal gene. However, functional studies elucidating causal variants, regulatory mechanisms, target cell types, and their causal impact on atherosclerosis have been lacking. This study aims to address this gap by establishing the variant-to-function relationship at the LIPA locus. Post-genome-wide association study pipelines and molecular biology techniques, including expression quantitative trait loci analysis, Tri-HiC, luciferase assay, CRISPRi, allele-specific binding, motif analysis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, were used to link functional variants to target genes and define the direction of their regulatory effects in causal cell types. To determine how increased myeloid LIPA impacts atherosclerosis, myeloid-specific Lipa overexpression mice on an Ldlr-/- background were generated. Coronary artery disease-risk alleles in the LIPA locus increase LIPA expression and enzyme activity specifically in monocytes/macrophages by enhancing PU.1 binding to an intronic enhancer region that interacts with the LIPA promoter. Myeloid-specific Lipa overexpression in Ldlr-/- mice fed a western diet resulted in larger atherosclerotic lesions, accompanied by altered macrophage function, characterized by increased accumulation of lesional macrophages derived from circulating monocytes, reduced neutral lipid content, and up-regulation of integrin and extracellular matrix pathway genes. The work establishes a direct causal link between LIPA-risk alleles and increased monocyte/macrophage LIPA that exacerbates atherosclerosis, bridging human functional genomic evidence to the mechanistic understanding of coronary artery disease.","Li, Fang; Flynn, Elise; Ha, Philip; Zebak, Mazal N; Cheng, Haoxiang; Xue, Chenyi; Shi, Jianting; Wu, Xun; Wang, Ziyi; Meng, Yujiao; Cui, Jian; Zhu, Yizhou; Rozenblyum, Annie; Chun, Jeana; Hernandez-Ono, Antonio; Javaheri, Ali; Razani, Babak; Westerterp, Marit; Bauer, Robert C; Suh, Yousin; Hao, Ke; Lappalainen, Tuuli; Zhang, Hanrui","Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Division of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine Institute, Department of Medicine, Department of Veterans Affairs, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Cardiometabolic Genomics Program, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th St, P&S 10-401, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Department of Gene Technology, Science for Life Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Genetic and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.; Cardiovascular Division, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.; New York Genome Center, New York, NY 10013, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; John Cochran Veterans Affairs Hospital, St Louis, MO 63106, USA.",European heart journal,Eur Heart J,,2025,08,19,2025,09,11,R01 HL151611_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; R35 HL177389_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; S10RR027050_GF_NIH HHS_United States; 20POST35130003 - FANG LI_AHA_American Heart Association-American Stroke Association_United States; S10OD020056_GF_NIH HHS_United States; P30CA013696_GF_NIH HHS_United States; R00 HL130574_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; 23CDA1052177_AHA_American Heart Association-American Stroke Association_United States; S10OD019973_GF_NIH HHS_United States; P30DK063608_GF_NIH HHS_United States; P01 HL172741_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827730,10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf581,40827730,0,,
40880099,Quantitative Genetics of Microbiome Mediated Traits.,"Multicellular organisms host a rich assemblage of associated microorganisms, collectively known as their ""microbiomes"". Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into components relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host-level selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, but that the contribution of non-vertical modes can depend strongly on host life history. Our work lays a foundation for integrating microbiome-mediated host variation and adaptation into our understanding of natural variation.","Week, Bob; Ralph, Peter L; Tavalire, Hannah F; Cresko, William A; Bohannan, Brendan J M","Advocate Aurora Research Institute, Advocate Health, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.; Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany.; Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon.; Zoological Institute, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany.; Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,Evolution,,2025,08,29,2025,09,09,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40880099,10.1093/evolut/qpaf171,40880099,0,0,NONE
40795117,Limited population structure but signals of recent selection in introduced African Fig Fly (Zaprionus indianus) in North America.,"Invasive species have devastating consequences for human health, food security, and the environment. Many invasive species adapt to new ecological niches following invasion, but little is known about the early steps of adaptation. Here we examine population genomics of a recently introduced drosophilid in North America, the African Fig Fly, Zaprionus indianus. This species is likely intolerant of subfreezing temperatures and recolonizes temperate environments yearly. We generated a new chromosome-level genome assembly for Z. indianus. Using resequencing of over 200 North American individuals collected over four years in temperate Virginia, plus a single collection from subtropical Florida, we tested for signatures of population structure and adaptation within invasive populations. We show founding populations are sometimes small and contain close genetic relatives, yet temporal population structure and differentiation of populations is mostly absent across North America. However, we identify two haplotypes that are differentiated between African and invasive populations and show signatures of selective sweeps. Both haplotypes contain genes in the cytochrome P450 pathway, indicating these sweeps may be related to pesticide resistance. X chromosome evolution in invasive populations is strikingly different from the autosomes, and a haplotype on the X chromosome that is differentiated between Virginia and Florida populations is a candidate for temperate adaptation. These results show that despite limited population structure, populations may rapidly evolve genetic differences early in an invasion. Further uncovering how these genomic regions influence invasive potential and success in new environments will advance our understanding of how organisms evolve in changing environments.","Erickson, Priscilla A; Stellwagen, Alexandra; Bangerter, Alyssa; Gunter, Ansleigh; Polizos, Nikolaos T; Bergland, Alan O","University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903, USA.; University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia 23173, USA.; University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida 33146, USA.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",G3 (Bethesda),,2025,08,07,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40795117,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf178,40795117,0,,

Its core components include TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) and TER (telomerase RNA). This study focused on the identification of the putative MgTER gene, which encodes the telomerase RNA subunit, in Malassezia globosa through comparative genomics. Unlike the corresponding genes in other yeasts and filamentous fungi, this gene is compact and uniform in length, resembling similar genes in vertebrates, while retaining characteristic elements that are crucial for TER and snRNA biogenesis and activity. These elements include the template domain, pseudoknot domain, CR4/5 domain, and a putative Sm-binding site. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis confirmed the transcriptional activity of the putative MgTER gene, reinforcing its potential functional significance within this organism. These results establish a robust basis for future experimental investigations to verify the functionality and regulatory mechanisms of this gene, particularly its role in telomere maintenance and broader cellular processes.","Sanpedro Luna, Juan Antonio; Sánchez Alonso, Patricia","Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Microbiológicas, Instituto de Ciencias, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Puebla, México.

Severe infections can result in total crop loss. To investigate its virulence repertoire, we generated a high-quality genome assembly of strain GW18.1 using long-read sequencing, resulting in 22 scaffolds, including four complete chromosomes and 12 chromosome arms, with a total genome size of 35.6 Mb and 10,289 predicted protein-coding genes. Two additional strains (TN2 and LB22.1) were sequenced with short reads to assess intraspecies diversity. Comparative genomics revealed a conserved virulence factor repertoire, including 314 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), 17 cytochrome P450s, 35 peroxidases, and 20 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Trophic lifestyle prediction based on gene content supports a biotrophic-like lifestyle consistent with hemibiotrophic pathogens. Broader comparisons with other Phyllosticta species and ten plant-pathogenic fungi pointed to species-specific features, while analysis of gene family evolution identified expansions and contractions in transporters and CAZymes. These genomic resources will support efforts to better understand and manage grapevine black rot.","Colombo, Monica; Bettinelli, Paola; Garcia, Jadran; Maddalena, Giuliana; Toffolatti, Silvia Laura; Hausmann, Ludger; Vezzulli, Silvia; Masiero, Simona; Cantù, Dario","Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie e Ambientali, Università degli Studi di Milano, 20133, Milano, MI, Italy.; Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Università degli Studi di Milano, 20133, Milano, MI, Italy.; Grapevine Physiology and Breeding Unit, Research and Innovation Centre, Fondazione Edmund Mach, 38098, San Michele all'Adige, TN, Italy.; Council for Agricultural Research and Economics, Research Centre for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Fiorenzuola d'Arda, 29017, San Protaso, PC, Italy.; Department of Viticulture and Enology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.; Julius Kuhn Institute, Institute for Grapevine Breeding Geilweilerhof, 76833, Siebeldingen, Germany.; Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",G3 (Bethesda),,2025,08,19,2025,08,19,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827360,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf186,40827360,0,,
40916467,Genome-wide association study reveals candidate loci for resistance to anthracnose in blueberry.,"Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, poses a significant threat to blueberries, necessitating a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to develop efficient breeding strategies. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study on 355 advanced selections of southern highbush blueberry from the University of Florida Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Program. Visual scores and image analyses were used for assessing disease severity. The population was genotyped using Capture-Seq, detecting 38,379 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The study revealed a moderate narrow-sense heritability estimate (∼0.5) for anthracnose resistance in blueberries. Minor additive loci contributing to anthracnose resistance were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12, using two different phenotyping approaches. Visual and image-based phenotyping captured complementary aspects of anthracnose resistance, identifying distinct, non-overlapping SNP associations. Candidate gene mining flanking significant associations unveiled key defense-related proteins, such as serine/threonine protein kinases, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins, E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been well-known for their roles in plant defense signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the complex and quantitative resistance mechanism for anthracnose in blueberry, providing insights for breeding strategies and sustainable disease management.","Ghimire, Lushan; Adunola, Paul; Harmon, Philip F; Azevedo, Camila F; Schultz, Tyler J; Leme, Bruno; Enciso-Rodriguez, Felix; Benevenuto, Juliana; Ferrão, Luis Felipe V; Munoz, Patricio R","Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Lab, Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Department of Statistics, Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, MG, 36570-000, Brazil.; Plant Breeding Graduate Program, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Plant Pathology Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",G3 (Bethesda),,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916467,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf187,40916467,0,0,NONE

C. campestris, the study species, is a widely studied model parasite, due in part to its worldwide occurrence as a weed of agricultural and natural plant communities. The species has served as a model parasite for studies of parasite biology, haustorium development, growth responses to chemical and light stimuli, gene content and expression, horizontal gene transfer, interspecies RNA movement, and has a recently developed transformation system. The 505 Mb (1C) genome is assembled into 31 chromosomes and supports annotation of 47,199 protein-coding genes, 214 small RNA loci (including 146 haustoria-specific miRNAs), and 3,238 interspecies mobile mRNA loci. C. campestris is a recent tetraploid with a high retention of duplicated genes and chromosomes, and less than 8% nucleotide divergence between homoeologous chromosomes. We also show that transformation of C. campestris with the RUBY marker system allows visualization of transformed Cuscuta-derived fluorescent mobile molecules that have entered the host stem.

Despite their rapid phenotypic evolution and a rich history of inspiring evolutionary biologists, genomic resources for these charismatic beetles remain limited, especially for the Giant Hercules beetles. We present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of a Giant Hercules beetle from the Lesser Antilles.

Additionally, we detected candidate sex-linked chromosomes by comparing sequencing read depths between one male and two females using Illumina short reads. The chromosome-level genome assembly of Dynastes reidi not only provides critical insights into evolutionary and functional genomics, but also supports informed conservation and management efforts.

Despite the increasing clinical significance, genomic data for M. clavatus remain limited. In this study, we report the first chromosomal-level genome assembly of M. clavatus using hybrid sequencing with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies. Three clinical isolates obtained from ICU patients in Verona (Italy) were sequenced and analyzed. The M. clavatus genome was resolved into four nuclear chromosomes and one circular mitochondrial genome, with a total length of 17.6 Mb and with 4,065 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses revealed structural differences from its closely related species M. capitatus. Phylogenetic analysis of 40 strains assembled on the resolved genome identified a novel clade (D), distinct from the previously described clades A, B, and C. All isolates exhibited intrinsic resistance to echinocandins and fluconazole. Genetic analysis identified conserved mutations in the FKS1 hotspot region encoding 1,3-β-glucan synthase, mirroring resistance-associated substitutions in M. capitatus. Additionally, a putative cyp51 homologue was identified as a likely contributor to azole resistance, suggesting conserved resistance mechanisms across Magnusiomyces species. This study discloses a new chromosomal-level assembly for M. clavatus, providing a significant genomic framework. This resource could enhance the accuracy of diagnostic methods, enabling comparative genomics with closely related fungi and facilitate a deeper investigation into the mechanisms of antifungal resistance and pathogenicity of this rare but increasingly reported pathogen.","Tonon, Emil; Cecchetto, Riccardo; Carrera, Maya; Sorrentino, Annarita; Zeni, Guido; Turri, Giona; Mantoan, Marco; Palmisano, Asia; Lagni, Anna; Lotti, Virginia; Diani, Erica; Gibellini, Davide","Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, Division of Microbiology, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.; UOC Microbiology, AOUI Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.; Department of Diagnostic and Public Health, Division of Hygiene and Preventive, Environmental and Occupational Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.; Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna, 25124 Brescia, Italy.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",G3 (Bethesda),,2025,09,03,2025,09,03,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40902102,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf201,40902102,0,0,NONE
40913589,Calcium starvation leads to strain-specific gene regulation of lipid and carotenoid production in Mucor Circinelloides.,"Fungi are pivotal in transitioning to a bio-based, circular economy due to their ability to transform organic material into valuable products such as organic acids, enzymes, and drugs. Mucor circinelloides is a model organism for studying lipogenesis and is particularly promising for its metabolic capabilities in producing oils like TAGs and carotenoids, influenced by environmental factors such as nutrient availability. Notably, strains VI04473 and FRR5020 have been identified for their potential in producing single-cell oils and carotenoids, respectively. Calcium starvation has previously been shown to have strain-specific effects, with VI04473 accumulating more lipids and FRR5020 producing more carotenoids. Here we used genome sequencing, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolite phenotyping to explore the genetic basis of lipid and carotenoid production under calcium starvation in these strains. We found extensive genomic rearrangements between these strains, as well as low conservation of gene regulatory responses to calcium depletion. This lack of conservation also applies to genes involved in lipid and carotenoid production, i.e. the lipidome. Crucially, we identified several metabolic pathways with distinct transcriptional responses to calcium depletion, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized, strain-dependent mechanism by which calcium signaling modulates metabolite production. This points to a potentially novel regulatory pathway linking calcium homeostasis to secondary metabolism in fungi, which may be linked to the complex gene family evolution of several lipidome-genes. Our study sheds light on the complexity of the evolution of metabolic networks in M. circinelloides. Understanding these genetic underpinnings can optimize the industrial use of M. circinelloides, enhancing lipid productivity and stress tolerance, and tailoring metabolic profiles for specific applications.","Baalsrud, Helle Tessand; Byrtusova, Dana; To, Thu-Hien; Larsen, Ida Emilie; Bøe, Veronica Aarvik; Grønvold, Lars; Fu, Juan; Árnyasi, Mariann; Shapaval, Volha; Sandve, Simen Rød","Norwegian University of Life Sciences, 1433 Ås, Norway.","G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",G3 (Bethesda),,2025,09,06,2025,09,06,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40913589,10.1093/g3journal/jkaf207,40913589,0,0,NONE

Phylogenetic Genotype to Phenotype mapping methods are a relatively new set of tools that aim to identify genomic regions associated with trait variation between species. Here, we review recent developments in Phylogenetic Genotype to Phenotype mapping methods, focusing on three key areas: methods based on replicated substitutions at individual amino acid sites; methods detecting changes in evolutionary rates; and methods analyzing gene duplication and loss. We discuss how trait definition and measurement can impact these methods, as well as the genetic mechanisms that can give rise to trait variation between lineages. We examine the strengths and limitations of different approaches, highlighting the importance of explicit modeling of evolutionary processes. Finally, we outline promising future directions, including the integration of within-species variation, as well as epigenetic and environmental information. Since no single method is likely to identify all genomic regions of interest, we encourage users to apply a representative range of methods that are capable of detecting different types of associations.

40838803,"Inter-Island Whole-Genome Comparison Reveals Micro-Evolutionary Dynamics of the Red Fox, Stimulated Through Post-Glacial Sea-Level Alterations.","Continental islands provide a system for understanding the mechanisms behind allopatric evolution. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is characterized by its remarkable dispersibility and adaptability, covering the widest distributional range among the Carnivora. The Hondo red fox (V. v. japonica) is a distinctive subspecies that evolved within the Japanese Archipelago, which has an intricate geohistory. Their genomic evolution process among islands offers valuable insights into the relationships between diversification of terrestrial organisms and geographic dynamics associated with climate changes, and conservation of these unique populations. We constructed novel ∼2.4 Gbp whole-genome assemblies with high coverage depth of four wild Hondo red foxes across three predominant islands and estimated the genomic distance, phylogeny, diversity, demography, and split time to reconstruct their biogeographic history at a spatiotemporally fine scale. Despite having a large geographic distance between one another, the pairwise genomic distance was closest between two individuals on the same island. Phylogenetic divergence pattern and runs of homozygosity supported disparate genetic characteristics per island. Historical demographic dynamics exhibited independent trajectories on each island following the Last Glacial, and sudden demographic differentiation was detected during the Hypsithermal. These findings indicate that post-glacial marine transgression degenerated land bridges between islands and strongly contributed to allopatric evolution, even for the highly dispersive generalist. Modern three-island populations are likely considered as respective evolutionarily significant units. This study expands our knowledge regarding the evolutionary history of the red fox and offers crucial insights into the formation process of biodiversity and endemism in terrestrial animals on continental islands.","Watanabe, Takumi; Satoh, Shin Shinojima; Shiraishi, Toshiaki; Kubota, Shosei; Yamazaki, Yuji","Biotechnological Research Support Division, FASMAC Company Limited, Atsugi, Kanagawa 243-0021, Japan.; Graduate School of Science and Engineering, University of Toyama, Toyama, Toyama 930-8555, Japan.; Division of Natural Environmental Science, Mount Fuji Research Institute, Yamanashi Prefectural Government, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi 403-0005, Japan.; Curatorial Division, Tateyama Caldera Sabo Museum, Tateyama, Toyama 930-1405, Japan.",Genome biology and evolution,Genome Biol Evol,"Animals, Foxes, Phylogeny, Evolution, Molecular, Islands, Genome, Biological Evolution, Climate Change, Phylogeography",2025,08,21,2025,08,25,JPMJSP2145_NONE_Pioneering Research Initiated by the Next Generation_; NONE_NONE_Japan Science and Technology Agency_; NONE_NONE_FIRSTBANK of Toyama Scholarship Foundation Research Grant_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40838803,10.1093/gbe/evaf152,40838803,0,0,NONE

Besides being a hallmark of bioenergetics, this enzyme complex is critical for maintaining redox homeostasis and facilitating transport. However, its evolutionary origins are unclear due to challenges in identifying close homologs and subunit ancestry. Using custom hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles, we analyzed the prokaryotic genome space to trace the distribution of 14 core C-I or NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nuo) subunits. Our findings include (i) a sensitive HMMER-based workflow for comprehensively annotating and analyzing the Nuo subunits, adaptable for similar analyses; (ii) the first species-level distribution of Nuo subunits; (iii) multiple C-I variants across ∼11,000 species, with 51.2% having a complete complex; (iv) C-I variants on plasmids, aiding evolutionary spread; and (v) extending our workflow to study mitochondrial C-I accessory subunits in prokaryotes, revealing their evolutionary roots. We also developed a web application to share our resources. Together, we comprehensively account for the distribution and probable evolutionary scheme of C-I subunits among prokaryotes.","Shirsath, Akshay; Khairnar, Snehal V; Anand, Abhirath; Prabhakaran, Divya M; Anand, Amitesh","Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400005, India.",Genome biology and evolution,Genome Biol Evol,"Hidden Markov Models, Quinone Reductases, Prokaryotic Cells, Genome, Datasets as Topic, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Protein Subunits, Evolution, Molecular, Phylogeny, Humans, Mitochondria",2025,08,07,2025,09,17,NONE_NONE_Amitesh Anand_; 19P0120_NONE_DAE-Tata Institute of Fundamental Research_; 21X432_NONE_DBT-Ramalingaswami Fellowship_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40795046,10.1093/gbe/evaf154,40795046,0,,
40796329,Gene family evolution suggests correlated dietary adaptations in butterflies and moths.,"Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are a megadiverse lineage of more than 160,000 described species. Their evolutionary success is thought to be tightly correlated with the radiation of flowering plants, but mechanisms on how these insects evolved to feed on so many different plant hosts remain largely unknown. Previous studies found emergent gene families of odorant receptors and peptidases in the ancestor of Lepidoptera, suggesting these genetic innovations may be linked to lepidopteran diversification. Here, we examined 62 genomes and identify lineage-specific gene families within the Lepidoptera and its three major clades. We found 54, 88, 77 and four functionally annotated gene families specific to Lepidoptera, Glossata, Ditrysia, and Apoditrysia, respectively. These families are involved in chemosensation, digestion, detoxification, immunity and other diverse functions. Notably, there is a marked increase in gene families presumably associated with chemosensation and immunity in Glossata and Ditrysia which encompass more than 98% of Lepidoptera diversity. We also identified horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events of two putative digestion gene families (Catalytic LigB subunit of aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase and Glycosyl hydrolases family 32) and a detoxification gene family (Cysteine synthase-like) to the common ancestors of Lepidoptera and Ditrysia, respectively. These HGT events likely played a crucial role in facilitating dietary transitions from algae, diatoms, and aquatic plant debris to fungi and primitive terrestrial plants in early Lepidoptera, ultimately enabling their adaptation to feed on and diversify with angiosperms since the emergence of Ditrysia.","Weng, Yi-Ming; Martinez, Jose I; Markee, Amanda; Plotkin, David; Sondhi, Yash; Mongue, Andrew J; Frandsen, Paul B; Kawahara, Akito Y","Department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.; Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; American Museum of Natural History, Richard Gilder Graduate School, New York, NY, USA.; McGuire Center for Lepidoptera & Biodiversity, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.; Department of Plant and Wildlife Sciences, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, USA.",Genome biology and evolution,Genome Biol Evol,,2025,08,12,2025,08,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40796329,10.1093/gbe/evaf156,40796329,0,,
40802548,The Genomic Basis of the Svalbard Reindeer's Adaptation to an Extreme Arctic Environment.,"Studying adaptation to extreme climates is essential for understanding evolutionary processes and how species evolve and persist under changing environmental conditions, such as climate warming. Here, we investigate the genomic basis of adaptations in the Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), an endemic subspecies that colonized the High Arctic approximately 7,000 years ago and developed a suite of adaptations for survival under conditions of extreme cold, changes in day length, and resource scarcity. Applying scans of selection, functional analysis of coding region variation, and characterization of copy number variation across reindeer populations from Svalbard, mainland Norway, mainland Russia, and Novaya Zemlya, our comparative genomics approach identified 150 genomic regions that are differentiated in Svalbard reindeer relative to mainland reindeer (R. tarandus). These genomic regions include genes linked to fat metabolism, energy conservation, cold tolerance, body size, fur morphology, and seasonal circadian rhythm. Our study highlights the advantages of using distinct approaches to uncover the genomic basis of adaptations and provides a path for future research into the evolution of species in similar environments.","Dussex, Nicolas; Bieker, Vanessa C; Sun, Xin; Le Moullec, Mathilde; Ersmark, Erik; Røed, Knut H; Speakman, John R; Loe, Leif Egil; Dalén, Love; Hansen, Brage B; Martin, Michael D","School of Biological Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, UK.; Department of Population Analysis and Monitoring, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm 114 18, Sweden.; Department of Bioinformatics and Genetics, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm 114 18, Sweden.; Gjærevoll Centre for Biodiversity Foresight Analyses, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim 7034, Norway.; Department of Preclinical Sciences and Pathology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, P.O.

40830069,Temporal genomics reveal a century of genomic diversity shifts across a biodiversity hotspot avian assemblage.,"Biodiversity has experienced tremendous shifts in community, species, and genetic diversity during the Anthropocene. Understanding temporal diversity shifts is especially critical in biodiversity hotspots, i.e., regions that are exceptionally biodiverse and threatened. Here, we use museomics and temporal genomics approaches to quantify temporal shifts in genomic diversity in an assemblage of eight generalist highland bird species from the Ethiopian Highlands (part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot). With genomic data from contemporary and historical samples, we demonstrate an assemblage-wide trend of increased genomic diversity through time, potentially due to improved habitat connectivity within highland regions. Genomic diversity shifts in these generalist species contrast with general trends of genomic diversity declines in specialist or imperiled species. In addition to genetic diversity shifts, we found an assemblage-wide trend of decreased realized mutational load, indicative of overall trends for potentially deleterious variation to be masked or selectively purged. Across this avian assemblage, we also show that shifts in population genomic structure are idiosyncratic, with species-specific trends. These results are in contrast with other charismatic and imperiled African taxa that have largely shown strong increases in population genetic structure over the recent past. This study highlights that not all taxa respond the same to environmental change, and generalists, in some cases, may even respond positively. Future comparative conservation genomics assessments on species groups or assemblages with varied natural history characteristics would help us better understand how diverse taxa respond to anthropogenic landscape changes.","Manthey, Joseph D; Settlecowski, Amie E; Meheretu, Yonas; Behrends, Garrett J; Bourgeois, Yann; Campillo, Luke C; Boissinot, Stéphane; Marks, Ben D","New York University Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.; Hawaii Cooperative Studies Unit.

40879756,The landscape of structural variation in aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis).,"Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) are one of the 25 most critically endangered primate species in the world. Endemic to Madagascar, their small and highly fragmented populations make them particularly vulnerable to both genetic disease and anthropogenic environmental changes. Over the past decade, conservation genomic efforts have largely focused on inferring and monitoring population structure based on single nucleotide variants to identify and protect critical areas of genetic diversity. However, the recent release of a highly contiguous genome assembly allows, for the first time, for the study of structural genomic variation (deletions, duplications, insertions, and inversions) which are likely to impact a substantial proportion of the species' genome. Based on whole-genome data from 14 individuals, >1,000 autosomal structural variants were detected, affecting ∼240 kb of the aye-aye genome. The majority of these variants (>85%) were deletions shorter than 200 bp, consistent with the notion that longer structural mutations are often associated with strongly deleterious fitness effects. For example, two deletions longer than 850 bp located within disease-linked genes were predicted to impose substantial fitness deficits owing to a resulting frameshift and gene fusion, respectively; whereas several other major effect variants outside of coding regions are likely to impact gene regulatory landscapes. Taken together, this first glimpse into the landscape of structural variation in aye-ayes will enable future opportunities to advance our understanding of the traits impacting the fitness of this endangered species, as well as allow for enhanced evolutionary comparisons across the full primate clade.","Versoza, Cyril J; Jensen, Jeffrey D; Pfeifer, Susanne P","Center for Evolution and Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.",Genome biology and evolution,Genome Biol Evol,,2025,08,29,2025,09,09,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40879756,10.1093/gbe/evaf167,40879756,0,0,NONE

The perspective outlines historical policies, such as forced sterilization and immigration efforts targeting Indigenous populations. We explore how science is intertwined with eugenics and how eugenic ideologies continue to negatively impact Indigenous communities and science today. The work investigates the legacy of eugenics in shaping genetic studies, including genetic counseling and large-scale initiatives like the Human Genome Diversity Project. Additionally, we consider how institutions and biomedical research settings have committed inexcusable and unethical science that contributed to Indigenous peoples' attitudes toward genetic and biomedical research. The work addresses the challenges genetic testing, including direct-to-consumer testing, poses to Indigenous people's identities, culture, and sovereignty. Acknowledging this devastating history is essential to understanding its continued impact on Indigenous communities today. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts and strategies to effectively engage with Indigenous peoples in genetic research, emphasizing the responsibilities of modern researchers to build trust, ensure ethical practices, and contribute to inclusive and respectful science.","Sherman, Carissa A; Nataneli, Shirin; Claw, Katrina G; Mooney, Jazlyn A","Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO 80045, United States.",Genetics,Genetics,,2025,08,11,2025,08,12,"NONE_NONE_Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences_; NONE_NONE_USC WiSE_; NONE_HHMI_Howard Hughes Medical Institute_United States; NONE_NONE_National Science Foundation_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40796125,10.1093/genetics/iyaf127,40796125,0,,
40796162,Dark side of the honeymoon: reconstructing the Asian x European rose breeding history through the lens of genomics.,"Roses hold significant symbolic value in Western cultural heritage, often serving as a symbol of love and romance. Despite their ancient cultivation, the appreciation for the phenotypic diversity of roses emerged relatively recently, notably during the 19th century. This period is characterized by a remarkable expansion in the number of varieties, from around 100 to over 8,000, representing a golden age for roses. To trace the history of rose breeding in Europe and unveil genetic changes during this period, we gathered phenotypic and genetic data from 204 accessions. These included botanical roses and varieties cultivated between 1800 and 1910. Whole-genome sequences from 32 accessions were also included. Our analysis revealed a temporal shift in the genetic makeup, transitioning from a historical European to a near-Asian genetic background within a few generations. This shift was accompanied by a notable reduction in genetic diversity, attributed to the backcrossing with the less diverse Asian genepool, plus some genomic signatures of selection. We have generated the largest GWAS catalog for rose to date, offering a valuable resource for future breeding initiatives. We emphasize the critical importance of preserving ancient rose collections to safeguard diversity and ensure a sustainable breeding for the long term.","Leroy, Thibault; Albert, Elise; Thouroude, Tatiana; Baudino, Sylvie; Caissard, Jean-Claude; Chastellier, Annie; Chameau, Jérôme; Jeauffre, Julien; Loubert, Thérèse; Nindya Paramita, Saretta; Pernet, Alix; Soufflet-Freslon, Vanessa; Oghina-Pavie, Cristiana; Foucher, Fabrice; Hibrand-Saint Oyant, Laurence; Clotault, Jérémy","Université d'Angers, Institut Agro, INRAE, IRHS, SFR QUASAV, 49000 Angers, France.; Syngenta Seeds SAS, 31790 Saint-Sauveur, France.; GenPhySE, Université de Toulouse, INRAE, ENVT, 31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.; LBVpam-UMR5079, Université Jean Monnet Saint-Etienne, CNRS, 42023 Saint-Etienne, France.; Department of Botany and Biodiversity Research, University of Vienna, 1030 Vienna, Austria.; Roseraie Loubert, Les Rosiers-sur-Loire, 49350 Gennes-Val-de-Loire, France.; Université d'Angers, CNRS, TEMOS, SFR CONFLUENCES, 49045 Angers, France.",Genetics,Genetics,,2025,08,12,2025,08,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40796162,10.1093/genetics/iyaf163,40796162,0,,
40825568,Telomere-to-telomere African wild rice (Oryza longistaminata) reference genome reveals segmental and structural variation.,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important staple food crops worldwide, and its wild relatives serve as an important gene pool in its breeding. Compared with cultivated rice species, African wild rice (Oryza longistaminata) has several advantageous traits, such as resistance to increased biomass production, clonal propagation via rhizomes, and biotic stresses. However, previous O. longistaminata genome assemblies have been hampered by gaps and incompleteness, restricting detailed investigations into their genomes. To streamline breeding endeavors and facilitate functional genomics studies, we generated a 331-Mb telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly for this species using a hybrid approach combining PacBio HiFi, Hi-C, and CycloneSEQ ultra-long reads, covering all telomeres and centromeres across the 12 chromosomes. This newly assembled genome has markedly improved over previous versions. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of synteny with previously published genomes. A large number of structural variations were identified between O. longistaminata, O. glaberrima, and O. sativa. A total of 2,466 segmentally duplicated genes were enriched in cellular amino acid metabolic processes. We detected slight expansion of some subfamilies of resistance genes and transcription factors. This newly assembled T2T genome of O. longistaminata provides a valuable resource for the exploration and exploitation of beneficial alleles present in wild relative species of cultivated rice.","Guang, Xuanmin; Yang, Jingnan; Zhang, Shilai; Guo, Fei; Li, Linzhou; Lian, Xiaoping; Zeng, Tao; Cai, Chongyang; Liu, Fushu; Li, Zhihao; Hu, Yangzi; Fang, Dongming; He, Weiming; Sahu, Sunil Kumar; Li, Wangsheng; Lu, Haorong; Li, Yuxiang; Liu, Huan; Xu, Xun; Gu, Ying; Hu, Fengyi; Dong, Yuliang; Wei, Tong","BGI Research, Wuhan 430074, China.; State Key Laboratory for Vegetation Structure, Function and Construction (VegLab), Yunnan Technology Innovation Center of Perennial Rice, New Cornerstone Science Laboratory, School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genome and Multi-omics Technologies, BGI Research, Shenzhen 518083, China.; BGI Hangzhou, CycloneSEQ Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou 310030, China.; BGI Research, Shenzhen 518083, China.",GigaScience,Gigascience,"Oryza, Genome, Plant, Telomere, Genomics, Chromosomes, Plant, Genomic Structural Variation, Synteny",2025,08,18,2025,09,14,KQTD20221101093603011 to J.Y._NONE_Shenzhen Science and Technology Program_; 32322063 to S.Z._NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40825568,10.1093/gigascience/giaf074,40825568,1,,[40825568]
40880133,WaveSeekerNet: accurate prediction of influenza A virus subtypes and host source using attention-based deep learning.,"Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to animal health globally, with its ability to overcome species barriers and cause pandemics. Rapid and accurate IAV subtypes and host source prediction is crucial for effective surveillance and pandemic preparedness. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing viral genomic sequences, offering new ways to uncover hidden patterns associated with viral characteristics and host adaptation. We introduce WaveSeekerNet, a novel deep learning model for accurate and rapid prediction of IAV subtypes and host source. The model leverages attention-based mechanisms and efficient token mixing schemes, including the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform, to capture intricate patterns within viral RNA and protein sequences. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate WaveSeekerNet's superior performance to existing models that use the traditional self-attention mechanism. Notably, WaveSeekerNet rivals VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) in subtype prediction using the high-quality RNA sequences, achieving the maximum score of 1.0 on metrics, including the Balanced Accuracy, F1-score (Macro Average), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our approach to subtype and host source prediction also exceeds the pretrained ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models with respect to generalization performance and computational cost. Furthermore, WaveSeekerNet exhibits remarkable accuracy in distinguishing between human, avian, and other mammalian hosts. The ability of WaveSeekerNet to flag potential cross-species transmission events underscores its significant value for real-time surveillance and proactive pandemic preparedness efforts. WaveSeekerNet's superior performance, efficiency, and ability to flag potential cross-species transmission events highlight its potential for real-time surveillance and pandemic preparedness. This model represents a significant advancement in applying deep learning for IAV classification and holds promise for future epidemiological, veterinary studies, and public health interventions.","Nguyen, Hoang-Hai; Rudar, Josip; Lesperance, Nathaniel; Vernygora, Oksana; Taylor, Graham W; Laing, Chad; Lapen, David; Leung, Carson K; Lung, Oliver","Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada.; Science and Technology Branch, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A OC6, Canada.; National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3E 3M4, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada.; National Centre for Animal Diseases, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Lethbridge, Alberta T1J 5R7, Canada.; School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada.; Department of Integrative Biology & Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada.; Vector Institute, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0C6, Canada.",GigaScience,Gigascience,"Influenza A virus, Deep Learning, Animals, Humans, Influenza, Human, Computational Biology, Genome, Viral",2025,08,13,2025,09,01,NONE_NONE_Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada_; NONE_NONE_Canadian Institute for Advanced Research_; CSSP-2022-CP-2538_NONE_Canadian Safety and Security Program (CSSP)_; NONE_NONE_Government of Canada_; CBRF2-2023-00008_NONE_Canada Biomedical Research Fund_; CSSP-2023-CP-2620_NONE_Canadian Safety and Security Program (CSSP)_; NONE_NONE_Ontario Research Fund_; NONE_NONE_University of Manitoba_; NONE_NONE_Biomedical Research Infrastructure Fund_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40880133,10.1093/gigascience/giaf089,,,,
40884803,A comprehensive water buffalo pangenome reveals extensive structural variation linked to population-specific signatures of selection.,"Water buffalo is a cornerstone livestock species in many low- and middle-income countries, yet major gaps persist in its genomic characterization-complicated by the divergent karyotypes of its two subspecies (swamp and river). Such genomic complexity makes water buffalo a particularly good candidate for the use of graph genomics, which can capture variation missed by linear reference approaches. However, the utility of this approach to improve water buffalo has been largely unexplored. We present a comprehensive pangenome that integrates 4 newly generated, highly contiguous assemblies of Pakistani river buffalo with 8 publicly available assemblies from both subspecies. This doubles the number of accessible high-quality river buffalo genomes and provides the most contiguous assemblies for the subspecies to date. Using the pangenome to assay variation across 711 global samples, we uncovered extensive genomic diversity, including thousands of large structural variants absent from the reference genome, spanning over 140 Mb of additional sequence. We demonstrate the utility of these data by identifying putative functional indels and structural variants linked to selective sweeps in key genes involved in productivity and immune response across 26 populations. This study represents one of the first successful applications of graph genomics in water buffalo and offers valuable insights into how integrating assemblies can transform analyses of water buffalo and other species with complex evolutionary histories. We anticipate that these assemblies, as well as the pangenome and putative functional structural variants we have released, will accelerate efforts to unlock water buffalo's genetic potential, improving productivity and resilience in this economically important species.","Arshad, Fazeela; Jayaraman, Siddharth; Talenti, Andrea; Owen, Rachel; Mohsin, Muhammad; Mansoor, Shahid; Asif, Muhammad; Prendergast, James","Jamil ur Rehman Centre for Genome Research, International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi 75270, Pakistan.; The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Midlothian EH25 9RG, UK.; Agricultural Biotechnology Division, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering College (NIBGE-C), Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan.; Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS), Nilore, Islamabad, 45650, Pakistan.",GigaScience,Gigascience,"Animals, Buffaloes, Genome, Genomics, Selection, Genetic, Genetic Variation, Genetics, Population",2025,08,21,2025,09,02,NONE_NONE_Commonwealth Scholarship Commission_; BBS/E/RL/230001A_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BB/T019468/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40884803,10.1093/gigascience/giaf099,,,,

Functional genomics enriched with multi-layer annotations offers essential resources for exploring the genetic architecture of complex traits. In this study, we undertook an extensive characterization of regulatory variants for body weight related traits in cattle using a multi-omics approach. First, we identified seven candidate genes through an integrative analysis of selective sweeps and multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strategies using imputed whole-genome sequencing in a population of 1577 individuals. Subsequently, we uncovered 3340 eGenes [genes whose expression levels are significantly associated with genetic variants in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies] across 227 muscle samples. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) further revealed a total of 532 distinct candidate genes associated with body weight traits. Also, colocalization analyses unveiled 44 genes that were shared between eQTLs and GWAS. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis highlighted one target genomic region under positive selection with pleiotropic genes (LAP3, MED28, and NCAPG), and pinpointed a prioritized functional variant within the locus on Bos taurus autosome 6 (BTA6) with complex regulation for body weight by integrating GWAS, selective sweep, eQTL, TWAS, as well as epigenomic analysis and molecular validation. Additionally, convergent evolution analysis and phenome-wide association studies underscored the conservation of the locus across species. Our study provided a comprehensive understanding of the genetic regulation for body weight related traits through multi-omics analysis in cattle. Our findings contribute to unraveling the genetic mechanisms governing weight related traits and shed valuable light on the genetic improvement of farm animals.","Niu, Qunhao; Wu, Jiayuan; Wu, Tianyi; Zhang, Tianliu; Wang, Tianzhen; Zheng, Xu; Zhao, Zhida; Xu, Ling; Wang, Zezhao; Zhu, Bo; Zhang, Lupei; Gao, Huijiang; Liu, Geroge E; Li, Junya; Xu, Lingyang","Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory, United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Services, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.; State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding, Institute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.; School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 999077, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450046, China.","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,,2025,08,18,2025,08,18,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40824217,10.1093/gpbjnl/qzaf067,40824217,0,,
40857558,Precision and Accuracy in Quantitative Measurement of Gene Expression from Single-cell/nuclei RNA Sequencing Data.,"Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) have become essential tools for profiling gene expression across different cell types in biomedical research. While factors like RNA integrity, cell count, and sequencing depth are known to influence data quality, quantitative benchmarks and actionable guidelines are lacking. This gap contributes to variability in study designs and inconsistencies in downstream analyses. In this study, we systematically evaluated quantitative precision and accuracy in expression measures across 23 sc/snRNA-seq datasets comprising 3,682,576 cells from 339 samples. Precision was assessed using technical replicates based on pseudo-bulks created from subsampling. Accuracy was evaluated using sample-matched scRNA-seq and pooled-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of mononuclear phagocytes from four species. Our results show that precision and accuracy are generally low at the single-cell level, with reproducibility being strongly influenced by cell count and RNA quality. We established data-driven thresholds for optimizing study design, recommending at least 500 cells per cell type per individual to achieve reliable quantification. Furthermore, we showed that signal-to-noise ratio is a key metric for identifying reproducible differentially expressed genes. To support future research, we developed Variability In single-Cell gene Expressions (VICE), a tool that evaluates sc/snRNA-seq data quality and estimates the true positive rate of differential expression results based on sample size, observed noise levels, and expected effect size. These findings provide practical, evidence-based guidelines to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of sc/snRNA-seq studies.","Dai, Rujia; Zhang, Ming; Chu, Tianyao; Kopp, Richard; Zhang, Chunling; Liu, Kefu; Wang, Yue; Wang, Xusheng; Chen, Chao; Liu, Chunyu","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State, University, Virginia, VA 24061, USA.; Hunan Key Laboratory of Animal Models for Human Diseases, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.; MOE Key Laboratory of Rare Pediatric Diseases & Hunan Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, School of Life Sciences, and Department of Psychiatry, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410205, China.; Furong Laboratory, Changsha 410008, China.; Department of Neuroscience & Physiology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, 13210, USA.; Department of Genetics, Genomics, and Informatics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.; Department of Neurology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,,2025,08,26,2025,09,09,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40857558,10.1093/gpbjnl/qzaf077,40857558,0,0,NONE
40847540,The intricate dance of RNA-binding proteins: unveiling the mechanisms behind male infertility.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are indispensable for transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes during spermatogenesis, orchestrating germ cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. Despite their established importance, the contributions of RBPs in male infertility remain underexplored. Recently, a seminal Science publication reported an RBP atlas of 1744 murine testicular RBPs, 22 loss-of-function variants, and 137 deleterious missense variants identified in 1046 infertile patients, providing unprecedented opportunities to investigate their molecular and clinical relevance. Variants in RBP-related genes associated with azoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and asthenozoospermia highlight their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, comprehensive analyses that integrate genetic, functional, and clinical insights are still lacking. This review aims to systematically analyze the roles of RBPs in male infertility. Leveraging state-of-the-art datasets and experimental insights, it examines pathogenic variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and elucidates the gene-disease relationships (GDRs). Furthermore, it explores known RBP functions across spermatogenesis stages and identifies candidate RBP genes. By integrating these findings, this work provides a comprehensive framework to advance the genetic understanding of RBPs, and their potential as clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets in male infertility. We searched the PubMed database for articles until 13 July 2025, using the keywords 'RNA-binding protein', 'male infertility', 'spermatogenesis', 'sperm', 'genetic variant', 'functional analyses', and 'knockout mouse model'. Pathogenic variants and VUS in 1744 RBP-coding genes, retrieved from the ClinVar and PubMed databases, were systematically analyzed to classify GDRs by the International Male Infertility Genomics Consortium database. Functional data from RBP knockout mouse models were assessed to elucidate stage-specific roles in spermatogenesis. Candidate RBP genes lacking knockout mouse models were identified by mining the RBP atlas, alongside data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression, Human Protein Atlas, and Uniprot databases. The clinical potential of RBPs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets was also discussed. Our search generated ∼2000 records, and 331 relevant articles were ultimately included in the final text. Firstly, this review identified 177 pathogenic variants in 62 RBP genes and 91 VUS in 35 RBP genes, 15 of which have been confidently linked to human male infertility. Secondly, functional analyses of 124 RBP knockout mouse models revealed their stage-specific regulatory roles in spermatocytogenesis, spermatidogenesis, and spermiogenesis, offering insights into key processes such as piwi-interacting RNA biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and RNA stability. Thirdly, 38 RBP genes lacking knockout mouse models were screened as candidate RBP genes in male infertility, underscoring their potential for future functional investigations. Finally, this review discusses the clinical potential of RBPs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, including RNA-based drugs, small molecules, and gene editing technologies as innovative strategies to address RBP-related male infertility. This review highlights the role of RBPs in male infertility and offers a framework for integrating genetic, functional, and clinical data. By identifying candidate RBPs and their therapeutic potential, it lays the groundwork for future diagnostic advancements and personalized treatments in reproductive medicine.

40914875,Patient-Specific Regulatory Network Rewiring in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: How Genetic Polymorphisms Divert Incoming Signals and Contribute to Disease Pathogenesis.,"Intestinal cells receive incoming signals from neighboring cells and microbial communities. Upstream signaling pathways transduce these signals to reach transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are in non-coding genomic regions containing TF binding sites. These SNPs can alter TF binding affinity, leading to regulatory shifts: TFs may lose or gain binding sites, causing a significant rewiring of the incoming signals regulating gene expression. Understanding this rewiring offers critical insights into the cellular mechanisms driving IBD pathogenesis. To investigate this rewiring, we developed a systems genomics pipeline and analyzed individual genotype data from 2636 IBD patients to infer the incoming signals affecting patient-specific gene regulatory networks. Our in silico approach predicted changes in the repertoire of TFs binding to genomic loci due to IBD-associated non-coding SNPs in each patient compared to healthy controls. By functionally annotating the TFs in disease and healthy states, we highlighted the rewiring of upstream signaling pathways that may arise due to IBD-associated SNPs. We revealed that diverse non-coding SNP combinations in IBD patients lead to functional switches from healthy signals to disease-associated signals, capturing patient heterogeneity while uncovering common upstream regulators driving disease pathogenesis. Notably, rewired incoming signals belonged to key functional processes such as pro-inflammatory immune responses, epithelial barrier dysfunction, stress responses, wound healing, and antimicrobial defense pathways. In summary, this work highlights the importance of personalized investigation of signaling processes upstream of genetic polymorphisms to gain a more comprehensive understanding of IBD pathogenesis.","Bohar, Balazs; Thomas, John P; Liu, Yufan; Brooks-Warburton, Johanne; Verstockt, Bram; Powell, Nick; Korcsmaros, Tamas; Modos, Dezso","NIHR Imperial BRC Organoid Facility, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Systems Medicine, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department Gastroenterology & Hepatology, University Hospitals Leuven, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Gut Microbes and Health Programme, Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom.; Department of Clinical, Pharmaceutical and Biological Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hertford, United Kingdom.; UKRI MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Gastroenterology, Lister Hospital, Stevenage, United Kingdom.; Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,Inflamm Bowel Dis,,2025,09,07,2025,09,07,NONE_NONE_UKRI Medical Research Council_; NONE_NONE_Crohn's and Colitis UK_; NONE_NONE_Laboratory of Medical Sciences_; WT101159_WT__Wellcome Trust_United Kingdom; NONE_NONE_National Institute for Health Research_; 336159_ERC__European Research Council_International; BB/X011054/1_NONE_UKRI BBSRC Institute Strategic Programme Food Microbiome and Health_; NONE_NONE_NIHR_; NONE_NONE_Imperial College London_; BB/R012490/1_NONE_BBSRC Gut Microbes and Health Institute Strategic Programme_; NONE_NONE_NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre_; NONE_NONE_Imperial Biomedical Research Centre_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40914875,10.1093/ibd/izaf173,40914875,0,0,NONE
40860564,Rationally designed microbial communities in agri-food production systems: from research to market.,"Primary production needs to transition towards more sustainable systems that reduce environmental impact, mitigate climate change, and ensure healthy food production with limited use of chemical plant protection products, fertilizers, or antibiotics. Rationally designed microbial communities, or engineered microbial consortia, involve the intentional assembly of microorganisms that can underpin more sustainable primary production systems. Rationally designed microbial communities can for example, (i) enhance ecosystem resilience, (ii) improve bioremediation, (iii) enhance industrial processes, or (iv) prevent diseases. In the perspective, we discuss the route towards market applications with a focus on the methodology needed to rationally design microbial communities for applications in the agri-food production systems. Often <i>in silico</i> and <i>in vitro</i> approaches are considered as a continuous process that first consider the <i>in silico</i> genomic and then <i>in vitro</i> condition to develop microbial consortia. However, host-microbe interactions influence both the microbial community assembly and host phenotypes and need to be considered from an early stage when developing microbial communities. As such, we propose that the route towards market application(s) should, from a technical perspective include (i) the host of interest, (ii) a library of both slow and fast-growing species, and (iii) genomic information about functions present in the selected microbial consortia.","Schokker, Dirkjan; Stege, Paul B; Duhamel, Marie; Bekker, Martijn; Timmerman, Harro M; Kar, Soumya K; Smidt, Hauke; Zoetendal, Erwin G; van Overbeek, Leo; Meisner, Annelein","Wageningen Livestock Research, Animal Nutrition, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Gelderland, 6708WD, the Netherland.; UNLOCK, Wageningen University and Research and Delft University of Technology, Wageningen (6708PB) and Delft (2629HS), the Netherlands.; Wageningen Plant Research, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Gelderland, 6708PE, the Netherlands.; Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Wageningen University and Research, Lelystad, Flevoland, 8221RA, the Netherlands.; Wageningen Food and Biobased Research, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Gelderland, 6700AA, the Netherlands.; Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, Gelderland, 6708WE, the Netherlands.",ISME communications,ISME Commun,,2025,07,23,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40860564,10.1093/ismeco/ycaf121,40860564,0,0,NONE
40860566,CleanBar: a versatile demultiplexing tool for split-and-pool barcoding in single-cell omics.,"Split-and-pool barcoding generates thousands of unique barcode strings through sequential ligations in 96-well plates, making single-cell omics more accessible, thus advancing microbial ecology, particularly in studies of bacterial interactions with plasmids and bacteriophages. While the wet-lab aspects of the split-and-pool barcoding are well-documented, no universally applicable bioinformatic tool exists for demultiplexing single cells barcoded with this approach. We present CleanBar (https://github.com/tbcgit/cleanbar), a flexible tool for demultiplexing reads tagged with sequentially ligated barcodes, accommodating variations in barcode positions and linker lengths while preventing misclassification of natural barcode-like sequences and handling diverse ligation errors. It also provides statistics useful for optimizing laboratory procedures. We demonstrate CleanBar's performance with the Atrandi platform for microbial single-cell genomics, coupled with PacBio sequencing, to reach a cell throughput comparable with traditional bulk metagenomics, but overcoming its limitations in studying phage-bacteria interactions. In four <i>Klebsiella</i> strains infected with their corresponding phages and a control phage, the single-cell genomics revealed infection heterogeneity and enabled phage copy number estimation per cell. By combining efficiency, adaptability, and precision, CleanBar, when applied to the Atrandi split-and-pool barcoding platform and PacBio sequencing, serves as a powerful high-throughput tool for advancing microbial single-cell genomics and understanding microbial ecology and evolution.","Arnau, Vicente; Ortiz-Maiques, Alicia; Valero-Tebar, Juan; Mora-Quilis, Lucas; Kurmauskaite, Vaida; Campos Dopazo, Lorea; Domingo-Calap, Pilar; Džunková, Mária","Atrandi Biosciences, Savanorių pr. 178C-101, LT-03154 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Institute for Integrative Systems Biology (I2SysBio), University of Valencia and Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), 46980, Paterna, Valencia, Spain.",ISME communications,ISME Commun,,2025,08,01,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40860566,10.1093/ismeco/ycaf134,40860566,0,0,NONE
40910370,Net rate of lateral gene transfer in marine prokaryoplankton.,"Lateral gene transfer is a major evolutionary process in Bacteria and Archaea. Despite its importance, lateral gene transfer quantification in nature using traditional phylogenetic methods has been hampered by the rarity of most genes within the enormous microbial pangenomes. Here, we estimated lateral gene transfer rates within the epipelagic tropical and subtropical ocean using a global, randomized collection of single amplified genomes and a non-phylogenetic computational approach. By comparing the fraction of shared genes between pairs of genomes against a lateral gene transfer-free model, we show that an average cell line laterally acquires and retains ~13% of its genes every 1 million years. This translates to a net lateral gene transfer rate of ~250 genes L-1 seawater day-1 and involves both ""flexible"" and ""core"" genes. Our study indicates that whereas most genes are exchanged among closely related cells, the range of lateral gene transfer exceeds the contemporary definition of bacterial species, thus providing prokaryoplankton with extensive genetic resources for lateral gene transfer-based adaptation to environmental stressors. This offers an important starting point for the quantitative analysis of lateral gene transfer in natural settings and its incorporation into evolutionary and ecosystem studies and modeling.","Stepanauskas, Ramunas; Brown, Julia M; Arasti, Shayesteh; Mai, Uyen; Gavelis, Gregory; Pachiadaki, Maria; Bezuidt, Oliver; Munson-McGee, Jacob H; Chang, Tianyi; Biller, Steven J; Berube, Paul M; Mirarab, Siavash","Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Woods Hole, MA 02543, United States.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge, MA 02139, United States.; Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences; East Boothbay, ME 04544, United States.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California; San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0028, South Africa.; Department of Biological Sciences, Wellesley College; Wellesley, MA 02481, United States.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California; San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, United States.",The ISME journal,ISME J,"Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Seawater, Bacteria, Plankton, Archaea, Phylogeny, Evolution, Molecular",2025,09,05,2025,09,11,917971_NONE_Simons Foundation_; 1335810_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 1845967_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 510023_NONE_Simons Foundation_; 1826734_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 2049004_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 827839_NONE_Simons Foundation_; R35 GM142725_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; 2304066_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 929985_NONE_Simons Foundation_; 2048470_NONE_US National Science Foundation_; 1R35GM142725_NONE_US National Institute of Health_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40910370,10.1093/ismejo/wraf159,40910370,0,0,NONE
40794795,Central metabolism and development are rewired in lichenized cyanobacteria.,"Nostoc cyanobacteria are among the few organisms capable of fixing both carbon and nitrogen. These metabolic features are essential for the cyanolichen symbiosis, where Nostoc supplies both carbon (as glucose) and nitrogen (as ammonium) to a cyanolichen-forming fungal partner. This nutrient flow was established by seminal biochemical studies published in the 20th century. Since then, cyanolichen metabolism has received little attention, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the physiology of lichenized Nostoc remain mostly unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate the genomic and transcriptional changes that enable Nostoc's metabolic role in cyanolichens. We used comparative genomics across 243 genomes of Nostoc s. lat. coupled with metatranscriptomic experiments using Peltigera cyanolichens. We found that genes for photoautotrophic carbon fixation are upregulated in lichenized Nostoc. This likely results in a higher rate of carbon fixation that allows Nostoc to provide carbon to the fungal partner while meeting its own metabolic needs. We also found that the transfer of ammonium from Nostoc to the lichen-forming fungus is facilitated by two molecular mechanisms: (i) transcriptional downregulation of glutamine synthetase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonium assimilation in Nostoc; and (ii) frequent losses of a putative high-affinity ammonium permease, which likely reduces Nostoc's capacity to recapture leaked ammonium. Finally, we found that the development of motile hormogonia is downregulated in lichenized Nostoc, which resembles the repression of motility in Nostoc symbionts after they colonize symbiotic cavities of their plant hosts. Our results pave the way for a revival of cyanolichen ecophysiology in the omics era.","Garfias-Gallegos, Diego; Pardo-De la Hoz, Carlos J; Haughland, Diane L; Magain, Nicolas; Aguero, Blanka; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Lutzoni, François","Department of Renewable Resources, Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.; Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, United States.; Evolution and Conservation Biology, InBioS Research Center, Université de Liège, Liège 4000, Belgium.",The ISME journal,ISME J,"Nostoc, Symbiosis, Lichens, Nitrogen, Carbon Cycle, Carbon, Ammonium Compounds, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Gene Expression Profiling, Nitrogen Fixation, Genome, Bacterial, Cyanobacteria, Ascomycota",2025,08,07,2025,09,10,BEE 1929994_NONE_National Science Foundation_; NONE_NONE_Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40794795,10.1093/ismejo/wraf166,40794795,0,,
40888465,Metabolic versatility enables acetogens to colonize ruminants with diet-driven niche partitioning.,"Enteric methane emissions are energy losses from farmed ruminants and contribute to global warming. Diverting electrons and H2 flow toward beneficial fermentation products would mitigate ruminal methane emissions while improving feed efficiency. Acetogens can direct H2 and electrons to acetate production via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but methanogens have more competitive H2 affinities. Thus, it is unclear how acetogenesis subsists in the rumen. An analysis of 2102 globally derived rumen metagenomes from multiple ruminant species revealed that putative acetogens were phylogenetically diverse and capable of using carbohydrates or H2 as electron donors. The metabolic versatility of these acetogens may enable them to outcompete methanogens with lower versatility. Through animal trials, in vitro experiments, and DNA stable isotope probing, we verified the presence of diverse acetogens in beef cattle rumens and revealed that their niche partitioning is driven by contrasting fiber-rich and starch-rich diets. A fiber-rich diet enriched heterotrophic acetogens, which increased acetate formation while decreasing methane production. Overall, this study highlights the overlooked heterotrophy of acetogens in the rumen and their potential for mitigating enteric methane emissions.","Li, Qiushuang; Wang, Rong; Zhou, Xiang; Li, Shuya; Zhang, Shizhe; Zhang, Xiumin; Wang, Wenxing; Jiao, Jinzhen; Janssen, Peter H; Ungerfeld, Emilio M; Müller, Volker; Conrad, Ralf; Greening, Chris; Tan, Zhiliang; Fu, Bo; Wang, Min","Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg 35043, Germany.; State Key Laboratory of Forage Breeding-by-Design and Utilization, National Engineering Laboratory for Pollution Control and Waste Utilization in Livestock and Poultry Production, and Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Nutritional Physiology and Metabolic Process, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, Hunan 410125, China.; Department of Microbiology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia.; Grasslands Research Centre, AgResearch Limited, Palmerston North 11008, New Zealand.; Molecular Microbiology & Bioenergetics, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Max-von-Laue Str. 9, Frankfurt, Germany.; School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Wuxi University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214105, China.; School of Environmental and Ecology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214105, China.; Centro Regional de Investigación Carillanca, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA), Temuco, Vilcún 4880000, Chile.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.",The ISME journal,ISME J,,2025,09,01,2025,09,01,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40888465,10.1093/ismejo/wraf183,,,,
40879453,Characterization of blaOXA-542-mediated carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii.,"Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) causes multiple anatomical site infections, representing a significant public health threat. This study reports the isolation and characterization of a carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii harbouring blaOXA-542, followed by a comprehensive investigation of its antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and genomic characteristics. Firstly, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the broth microdilution method. Subsequently, whole-genome sequencing was employed to identify and characterize the resistance and virulence determinants. The functional validation of resistance mechanisms was performed by gene knockdown and construction of expression vectors. The fitness cost of β-lactamase expression was identified by a bacterial growth kinetic test. Molecular docking was utilized to predict potential binding sites of β-lactamase and carbapenems. Finally, the genetic characteristics of the isolates were analysed through comparative genomics analyses and phylogenetic tree construction. The results demonstrated that blaOXA-542 confers resistance to carbapenem and penicillin in A. baumannii and Escherichia coli while exhibiting no significant impact on cephalosporins. The ability of blaOXA-542 to hydrolyze meropenem was further confirmed by modified carbapenem inactivation assay (mCIM). Expression of blaOXA-542 in E. coli BL21 showed no significant growth rate alteration. Comparative analysis of the blaOXA-542 genetic environment revealed a close association with Acinetobacter pitti. This study reports the emergence of blaOXA-542-mediated carbapenem and penicillin resistance in a novel A. baumannii lineage (ST2795Pas/ST3464Oxf), highlighting the urgent need for rational antibiotic use against specific pathogens.","Hao, Jingchen; Lu, Feng; Chen, Ping; Ji, Chengjie; Li, Na; Xu, Yue; Chen, Yuehan; Liu, Cuicui; Hu, Jian; Li, Guocai","Department of Laboratory Medicine, Xuyi People's Hospital/Clinical College, Yangzhou University, Huai'an 211799, China.; Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medicine, First Clinical Medical College, Faculty of Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, China.; The Key Laboratory of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions for Nucleic Acid & Cell Fate Regulation, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yixing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Yixing Clinical College of Yangzhou University, Yixing 214200, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225001, China.; Department of Experimental Medicine, The People's Hospital of Jianyang City, Jianyang, Chengdu 641400, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fifth People's Hospital of Huai'an/Huai'an Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University, Huai'an 223300, China.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,J Antimicrob Chemother,,2025,08,29,2025,08,29,82373637_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; BK20231241_NONE_Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; 82002186_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; YZ2023104_NONE_Yangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project_; 82073611_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40879453,10.1093/jac/dkaf311,,,,
40796304,Comparative genomics reveals the genetic diversity and plasticity of Clostridium tertium.,"Clostridium tertium, increasingly recognized as the emerging human pathogen frequently isolated from environmental and clinical specimens, remains genetically underexplored despite its clinical relevance. This study aims to explore the genetic characteristics of C. tertium by genomic analysis. This study presented a comprehensive genomic investigation of 45 C. tertium strains from the GenBank database. Genome sizes (3.27-4.55 Mbp) and coding gene counts varied markedly across strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and core genome uncovered distinct intra-species lineages, including evolutionarily divergent clusters likely shaped by niche specialization. Pan-genomic analysis confirmed an open genome, with accessory and strain-specific genes enriched in functions related to environmental adaptation and regulation. Functional annotation further identified diverse virulence factor genes (e.g. clpP, nagK) and antibiotic resistance genes [e.g. vatB, tetA(P)] co-occurring with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may be a key driver of genome plasticity in C. tertium. Notably, one-third of the strains carried CRISPR-Cas systems, indicating the defense potential against exogenous genetic elements. Clostridium tertium exhibited extensive genetic diversity and genome plasticity, probably driven by MGE-mediated HGT, defense mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas systems, and functional adaptation related to virulence and resistance. These traits may underlie its ability to colonize diverse environments and acquire pathogenicity and resistance.","Qing, Yunming; Liao, Zhengchang; An, Di; Zeng, Ying; Zhu, Qin; Zhang, Xian","Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.; Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.; Department of Gynecology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.; Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.",Journal of applied microbiology,J Appl Microbiol,"Genetic Variation, Phylogeny, Clostridium, Genome, Bacterial, Genomics, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Virulence Factors, Humans, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Interspersed Repetitive Sequences, CRISPR-Cas Systems",2025,08,12,2025,08,22,1053320242380_NONE_Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University_; 2025JJ50123_NONE_Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation_; 32101368_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 2022YFE0119600_NONE_National Key Research and Development Program of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40796304,10.1093/jambio/lxaf201,40796304,0,,

To address this, we aim to develop a novel multimodal method, DeepAFM, that integrates histopathology, genomic features, and clinical information to predict patient responses to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy. A total of 93 patients with advanced NSCLC were included in this study. Histopathological whole-slide images were processed using a self-supervised VQVAE2 for representation learning. PCA and K-means clustering were then applied for dimensionality reduction and feature grouping. Key regions of interest were visualized through permutation importance evaluation and color-coding techniques. The extracted histopathological features, along with genomic alterations and clinical variables, were integrated into the DeepAFM multimodal prediction model. The DeepAFM achieved a high predictive performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.00). Attention-based heatmaps revealed that the model could identify critical pathological patterns, genomic mutations, and clinical indicators associated with patient responses to immunotherapy. The integration of multimodal data enabled the model to capture complex interactions among pathology, genomics, and clinical characteristics, enhancing the interpretability and predictive power of immunotherapy response prediction. The visualization techniques facilitated the identification of biologically meaningful features and potential biomarkers. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the DeepAFM in predicting responses to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC. The approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also provides valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies and biomarker discovery.","Wang, Zijun; Liu, Xi; Han, Kaitai; Lei, Lixin; Shi, Chaojing; Liu, Wu; Guo, Qianjin","Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology, 19 Qingyuan North Road, Daxing District, Beijing 102617, China.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,J Am Med Inform Assoc,,2025,09,03,2025,09,03,2019821001_NONE_Beijing Municipal Education Commission_; 52361145714_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 21673252_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; BIPTAAI-2021007_NONE_Climbing Program Foundation_; 2024003_NONE_ZhiYuan Fund Key Project of Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40901703,10.1093/jamia/ocaf142,40901703,0,0,NONE

40833630,"Towards Sustainable Agarwood Production: Integrating Microbial Interactions, Anatomical Changes, and Metabolite Biosynthesis.","Agarwood is a highly valuable non-timber forest product mainly derived from the Aquilaria genus, widely traded in the perfumery, religious items, and traditional medicine industries. Naturally, agarwood forms within the xylem as part of the tree's defense mechanism against environmental stressors and microbial infection. The escalating demand for agarwood has led to the overexploitation of Aquilaria species, with some now classified as critically endangered. Despite advancements in artificial induction methods for sustainable agarwood supply, the intricate links between physiological and molecular mechanisms governing its formation remain poorly understood. This review addresses these knowledge gaps by examining the interplay between morphological changes in xylem structure during tylose formation and molecular alterations, particularly the biosynthesis of 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones (PECs), key compounds in agarwood. Additionally, it integrates findings from multi-omics approaches including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics to reveal how secondary metabolite biosynthesis, including PECs and terpenes, is regulated across various Aquilaria species, regions, and induction techniques. The role of microbial communities, particularly endophytes such as Fusarium, in regulating agarwood formation is also discussed, emphasizing their involvement in both natural and artificial induction strategies. Furthermore, this review explores the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating morphological and biochemical defense responses, alongside the functions of transcription factors (TFs), protein kinases, and signaling molecules in balancing defense and growth. However, the crosstalk between key genes such as chalcone synthases, MAPK, cytochromes, NADPH oxidases, TFs, and miRNAs require further study to fully understand the complex defense mechanisms in Aquilaria trees. Overall, this review aims to bridge the current knowledge gaps by linking morphological and biochemical changes in agarwood formation, particularly PEC biosynthesis, while proposing metabolite engineering using microbial hosts as a promising tool for sustainable and technology-driven agarwood production.","Sampasivam, Yashirdisai; Razman, Khalisah Khairina; Mazlan, Nor Syakila Mohd; Azizan, Kamalrul Azlan; Ahlawat, Yogesh K; Othman, Roohaida","Allied Health Sciences, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, Maharashtra, India.; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 UKM Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.; Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 UKM Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.; Institute of Systems Biology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 UKM Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.; Department of Biotechnology, University Centre for Research and Development, Chandigarh University, Mohali, Punjab, India.; Centre for Research Impact and Outcome, Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Rajpura, Punjab 140401, India.",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol,,2025,08,20,2025,08,27,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40833630,10.1093/jimb/kuaf025,40833630,0,0,NONE
40824865,Footprints of Worldwide Adaptation in Structured Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Through the Expanded DEST 2.0 Genomic Resource.,"Large-scale genomic resources can place genetic variation into an ecologically informed context. To advance our understanding of the population genetics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we present an expanded release of the community-generated population genomics resource Drosophila Evolution over Space and Time (DEST 2.0; https://dest.bio/). This release includes 530 high-quality pooled libraries from flies collected across six continents over more than a decade (2009 to 2021), most at multiple time points per year; 211 of these libraries are sequenced and shared here for the first time. We used this enhanced resource to elucidate several aspects of the species' demographic history and identify novel signs of adaptation across spatial and temporal dimensions. For example, we showed that the spatial genetic structure of populations is stable over time, but that drift due to seasonal contractions of population size causes populations to diverge over time. We identified signals of adaptation that vary between continents in genomic regions associated with xenobiotic resistance, consistent with independent adaptation to common pesticides. Moreover, by analyzing samples collected during spring and fall across Europe, we provide new evidence for seasonal adaptation related to loci associated with pathogen response. Furthermore, we have also released an updated version of the DEST genome browser. This is a useful tool for studying spatiotemporal patterns of genetic variation in this classic model system.","Nunez, Joaquin C B; Coronado-Zamora, Marta; Gautier, Mathieu; Kapun, Martin; Steindl, Sonja;

40795033,Selection Maintains Photosynthesis in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium Despite Redundancy With its Fern Host.,"Vertically inherited symbionts experience different physical, chemical, and population genetic environments than free-living organisms. As a result, they can experience long-term reductions in effective population size (Ne) and weaker purifying selection on genes that are less important in the host-associated environment. Over time, these forces result in gene loss. A comparative genomic approach using independently evolved symbiotic bacteria and free-living relatives can reveal which genes are important in the symbiotic state. We apply this approach to understand why some diazotrophic cyanobacteria evolving as vertically inherited symbionts of photosynthetic eukaryotic hosts have lost their ancestral capacity for photosynthesis while others have retained that capacity. We look specifically at Trichormus azollae, a diazotrophic cyanobacterium that remains photosynthetic after 50 to 90 Ma as a vertically inherited symbiont of Azolla ferns. We show that gene loss is ongoing, with different genes lost across the eight T. azollae strains examined. We apply molecular evolutionary models to genomes of T. azollae and free-living relatives, finding genome-wide signatures of drift in T. azollae consistent with long-term reductions in Ne. Ribosomal proteins and proteins from the energy-capturing photosynthetic light reactions are under stronger purifying selection than genes from other pathways, including nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic carbon fixation. Strong purifying selection is expected for the ribosome given its extraordinary levels of conservation, even in ancient vertically inherited symbionts. That genes in the light reactions are under strong purifying selection and never lost in any strain suggests that energy capture, likely required for energy-intensive nitrogen fixation, remains important to this symbiont.","Friar, Liam; Keepers, Kyle; Garber, Arkadiy I; McCutcheon, John P; Wing, Boswell; Kane, Nolan C","Biodesign Institute and School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.; Department of Geological Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.",Molecular biology and evolution,Mol Biol Evol,"Symbiosis, Photosynthesis, Cyanobacteria, Selection, Genetic, Ferns, Evolution, Molecular, Genome, Bacterial",2025,08,07,2025,09,14,NONE_NONE_National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the U.S.A_; 80NSSC23K1357_NONE_NASA ICAR_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40795033,10.1093/molbev/msaf181,40795033,0,,
40852875,Convergent Evolution in Amblyopsid Cavefishes and the Age of Eastern North American Subterranean Ecosystems.,"Genomes provide tools for reconstructing organismal evolution and larger Earth system processes. Although genome sequences have been jointly analyzed with geological data to understand links between biological evolution and geological phenomena such as erosion and uplift, genomic and natural history observations have seldom been leveraged to reconstruct the timescale of landscape change in cases where traditional methods from the Earth sciences cannot. Here, we reconstruct the genomic evolution of cave-adapted amblyopsid fishes. Although high-resolution computed tomography reveals the strikingly similar skeletons of cave-adapted lineages, our analyses of the genomes of all species in this clade suggest that amblyopsids independently colonized caves and degenerated their eyes at least four times after descending from populations that already possessed adaptations to low-light environments. By examining pseudogenization through loss-of-function mutations in amblyopsids, we infer that the genomic bases of their vision degenerated over millions of years. We leverage these data to infer the ages of subterranean karstic ecosystems in eastern North America, which are difficult to date using standard geochronologic techniques. Our results support ancient ages for imperiled North American cave biotas and show how genomes can be used to inform the timescale of landscape evolution.","Brownstein, Chase D; Policarpo, Maxime; Harrington, Richard C; Hoffman, Eva A; Stokes, Maya F; Casane, Didier; Near, Thomas J","CNRS, IRD, UMR Évolution, Génomes, Comportement et Écologie, Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette 91198, France.; UFR Sciences du Vivant, Université Paris Cité, Paris 75013, France.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Zoological Institute, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Yale Peabody Museum, New Haven, CT, USA.; South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, Marine Resources Institute, Charleston, SC, USA.; Division of Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Earth, Ocean, & Atmospheric Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Evolution of Sensory and Physiological Systems, Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence, Martinsried, Germany.",Molecular biology and evolution,Mol Biol Evol,"Animals, Caves, Biological Evolution, Ecosystem, North America, Fishes, Phylogeny, Genome, Evolution, Molecular",2025,06,16,2025,08,29,NONE_NONE_Yale Peabody Museum_; NONE_NONE_Bigham Oceanographic Fund_; NONE_NONE_Yale Training Program in Genetics_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40852875,10.1093/molbev/msaf185,40852875,0,0,NONE
40812782,Metabolomics-Guided Genomic Comparisons Reveal Convergent Evolution of Hibernation Genes in Mammals.,"Hibernation exists in several unrelated mammalian lineages, allowing animals to survive extreme 0environmental conditions through profound physiological shifts, including reduced metabolic rate, heart rate, respiration, and body temperature. These physiological shifts allow hibernators to rely solely on fat reserves, simultaneously avoiding the adverse effects of prolonged immobility seen in nonhibernating species. Although research on individual species has highlighted key aspects of these adaptations, the genetic basis of hibernation across mammals remains poorly understood. Synthesizing both single species and comparative approaches, we use metabolomic data from waking and hibernating black bears (Ursus americanus) to guide bioinformatic analyses of genes using tests of selection and evolutionary rate convergence across independent lineages of hibernating mammals. Our analyses reveal significant changes in carnitine levels between states. Using public databases, we generate candidate genes which may contribute to regulation of carnitine, and use these to test for signatures of selection across several independent lineages of hibernating mammals. We also utilize a dataset of 19k proteins across 120 mammalian genomes to identify genes evolving at convergent rates across hibernating mammals. Using both approaches, we find several novel genes likely to impact carnitine metabolism and related functions vital to hibernation such as metabolic shifts, oxidative stress, and tissue preservation. These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of hibernation and offer promising targets for translational research, including the development of clinical therapies that mimic hibernation-like states for applications in medicine and space exploration.","Drabeck, Danielle H; Anderson, Myana; Roback, Emma Y; Lusczek, Elizabeth R; Tri, Andrew N; Lassen, Jens Flensted; Kowalczyk, Amanda E; McGaugh, Suzanne; Iles, Tinen L","Department of Cardiology B, Odense University Hospital Odense, Odense, Denmark.; Forest Wildlife and Populations Research Group, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Grand Rapids, MN, USA.; Department of Surgery, Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.; Form Bio, Austin, TX, USA.; Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, College of Biological Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, USA.",Molecular biology and evolution,Mol Biol Evol,"Animals, Hibernation, Ursidae, Evolution, Molecular, Metabolomics, Carnitine, Mammals, Biological Evolution",2025,08,14,2025,08,28,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40812782,10.1093/molbev/msaf188,40812782,0,,

Leveraging SNP-to-gene-to-trait linking strategies-including molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL), regulatory elements, and context- or environment-dependent regulatory heterogeneity-we developed the ChickenGTEx portal (http://chicken.farmgtex.org), which provides a comprehensive catalogue of regulatory effects on transcriptomic and phenotypic diversity across tissues, cell types, and sexes. Key features of the resource include a genotype imputation panel of 2869 chickens from 123 breeds worldwide, five types of molecular phenotypes across 28 tissues, ∼2.2 million molQTL, 806 229 fine-mapped molQTL, 1956 context-dependent molQTL, 257 genome-wide profiles of 7 epigenetic marks (representing 15 chromatin states) from 23 tissues, 185 376 single-cell expression profiles across 191 cell clusters from 9 tissues, and 96 386 gene-trait associations covering 108 economically important traits. In summary, the ChickenGTEx portal will serve as an invaluable resource for advancing research in fundamental and evolutionary biology, chicken precision breeding, and eventually human biomedicine.","Hou, Yali; Zou, Dong; Chu, Qin; Zhan, Bujie; Wang, Ruizhen; Guan, Dailu; Wang, Wannian; Feng, Xiao; Li, Xin; Zhu, Xiaoning; Bai, Zhonghao; Gao, Yahui; Yin, Hongwei; Xu, Tianyi; Yuan, Zhixiang; Hu, Xiaoxiang; Yang, Ning; Zhou, Huaijun; Fang, Lingzhao; Zhang, Zhang","Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing 100097, China.; Department of Animal Science, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu 030801, China.; Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Medical College, Longdong University, Qingyang 745000, China.; State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding; National Germplasm Center of Domestic Animal Resources, Institute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China.; State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.; Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450046, China.; Department of Animal Science, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States.; State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.; Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Multi-omics of MARA, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen 518124, China.; National Genomics Data Center, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.; Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG), Aarhus University, Aarhus 8000, Denmark.; Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.",Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res,,2025,08,19,2025,08,19,Y2025PT02_NONE_Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research_; NONE_NONE_Open Biodiversity and Health Big Data Programme of IUBS_; 32030021_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; ASTIP-IAS-04-2_NONE_Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program_; T2425005_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; NONE_NONE_Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences_; 153F11KYSB20160008_NONE_Chinese Academy of Sciences_; 2024YFF1000100_NONE_National Key Research and Development Program of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827640,10.1093/nar/gkaf731,40827640,0,,
40808301,Oncodrive3D: fast and accurate detection of structural clusters of somatic mutations under positive selection.,"Identifying the genes capable of driving tumorigenesis in different tissues is one of the central goals of cancer genomics. Computational methods that exploit different signals of positive selection in the pattern of mutations observed in genes across tumors have been developed to this end. One such signal of positive selection is clustering of mutations in areas of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the protein above the expectation under neutrality. Methods that exploit this signal have been hindered by the paucity of proteins with experimentally solved 3D structures covering their entire sequence. Here, we present Oncodrive3D, a computational method that, by exploiting AlphaFold 2 structural models, extends the identification of proteins with significant mutational 3D clusters to the entire human proteome. Oncodrive3D shows sensitivity and specificity on par with state-of-the-art cancer driver gene identification methods exploiting mutational clustering and clearly outperforms them in computational efficiency. We demonstrate, through several examples, how significant mutational 3D clusters identified by Oncodrive3D in different known or potential cancer driver genes can reveal details about the mechanism of tumorigenesis in different cancer types and in clonal hematopoiesis.","Pellegrini, Stefano; Dove-Estrella, Olivia; Muiños, Ferran; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Gonzalez-Perez, Abel","Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain.; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red en Cáncer (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid 28029, Spain.; Department of Medicine and Life Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain.; Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Baldiri Reixac 10, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res,"Humans, Mutation, Neoplasms, Software, Selection, Genetic, Models, Molecular, Cluster Analysis, Protein Conformation, Genomics",2025,08,14,2025,08,26,NONE_NONE_FSE_; AEI/10.13039/501100011033/_NONE_MCIN_; PID2021-126568OB-I00_NONE_Horizon Europe_; 101057509_NONE_Horizon Europe_; HORIZON-HLTH-2021-CARE-05-02_NONE_Horizon Europe_; NONE_NONE_Spanish Ministry of Science_; PRE2021-096986_NONE_MCIN_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40808301,10.1093/nar/gkaf776,40808301,0,,
40842240,ECSFinder: optimized prediction of evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures from genome sequences.,"Accurate prediction of RNA secondary structures is essential for understanding the evolutionary conservation and functional roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) across diverse species. In this study, we benchmarked two leading tools for predicting evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures (ECSs), SISSIz and R-scape, using two distinct experimental frameworks: one focusing on well-characterized mitochondrial RNA structures and the other on experimentally validated Rfam structures embedded within simulated genome alignments. While both tools performed similarly overall, each displayed subtle preferences in detecting ECSs. To overcome their individual limitations, we evaluated two interpretable machine learning approaches that integrate the strengths of both methods. By balancing thermodynamic stability features from RNALalifold and SISSIz with robust covariation metrics from R-scape, a random forest model classifier significantly outperformed individual tools in identifying ECSs. This classifier was implemented in ECSFinder, a new tool designed for large-scale comparative genomics applications, that can provide robust, genome-wide identification of conserved RNA structures, and offer valuable insights into the modular elements and evolutionary conservation of lncRNAs.","Gaonac'h-Lovejoy, Vanda; Mattick, John S; Sauvageau, Martin; Smith, Martin A","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.; UNSW RNA Institute, UNSW Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.; Department of Biochemistry and Center for RNA Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3G 1Y6, Canada.; CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.; Montreal Clinical Research Institute, Montreal, QC H2W 1R7, Canada.",Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res,"Nucleic Acid Conformation, Evolution, Molecular, RNA, Long Noncoding, Conserved Sequence, Software, RNA, Humans, Machine Learning, RNA, Mitochondrial, Animals, Algorithms, Genomics",2025,07,25,2025,08,27,zci-624_NONE_Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé_; 305 111_NONE_FRQS_; 284 217_NONE_Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé_; RGPIN-2022-04265_NONE_Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada_; NONE_NONE_Digital Research Alliance of Canada_; NONE_NONE_CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre_; RG193211_NONE_UNSW Sydney_; NONE_NONE_DeSève Foundation_; 330 732_NONE_FRQS Research Scholar Junior 2_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40842240,10.1093/nar/gkaf780,40842240,0,0,NONE
40829801,Kingdom-wide CRISPR guide design with ALLEGRO.,"Designing CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries targeting entire kingdoms of life will significantly advance genetic research in diverse and underexplored taxa. Current sgRNA design tools are often species-specific and fail to scale to large, phylogenetically diverse datasets, limiting their applicability to comparative genomics, evolutionary studies, and biotechnology. Here, we introduce ALLEGRO, a combinatorial optimization algorithm designed to compose minimal, yet highly effective sgRNA libraries targeting thousands of species at the same time. Leveraging integer linear programming, ALLEGRO identified compact sgRNA sets simultaneously targeting multiple genes of interest for over 2000 species across the fungal kingdom. We experimentally validated sgRNAs designed by ALLEGRO in Kluyveromyces marxianus, Komagataella phaffii, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, confirming successful genome edits. Additionally, we employed a generalized Cas9-ribonucleoprotein delivery system to apply ALLEGRO's sgRNA libraries to untested fungal genomes, such as Rhodotorula araucariae. Our experimental findings, together with cross-validation, demonstrate that ALLEGRO facilitates efficient CRISPR genome editing, enabling the development of universal sgRNA libraries applicable to entire taxonomic groups.","Mohseni, Amirsadra; Nia, Reyhane Ghorbani; Tafrishi, Aida; López, Mario León; Liu, Xin-Zhan; Stajich, Jason E; Lonardi, Stefano; Wheeldon, Ian","Microbiology and Plant Pathology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States.; Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.; Bioengineering, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States.; Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States.; Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, United States.",Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res,"RNA, Guide, CRISPR-Cas Systems, CRISPR-Cas Systems, Genome, Fungal, Gene Editing, Algorithms, Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, Yarrowia, Rhodotorula, Gene Library, Saccharomycetales",2025,08,19,2025,08,23,"EF-2125066_NONE_National Science Foundation_; CA-R-PPA-211-5062-H_NONE_U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture_; NSF-2225878_NONE_Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems_; DBI-2400327_NONE_National Science Foundation_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40829801,10.1093/nar/gkaf783,40829801,1,,[40566685]
40918064,Cell-free DNA as a potential alternative to genomic DNA in genetic studies.,"Next-generation sequencing has greatly advanced genomics, enabling large-scale studies of population genetics and complex traits. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from white blood cells has traditionally been the main data source, but cell-free DNA (cfDNA), found in bodily fluids as fragmented DNA, is increasingly recognized as a valuable biomarker in clinical and genetic studies. However, a direct comparison between cfDNA and gDNA has not been fully explored. In this study, we analyzed cfDNA and gDNA from 186 healthy individuals, using the same sequencing platform. We compared sequencing quality, variant detection, allele frequencies (AF), genotype concordance, population structure, and genomic association results (genome-wide association study and expression quantitative trait locus). While cfDNA showed higher duplication rates and lower effective sequencing depth, both DNA types displayed similar quality metrics at the same depth. We also observed that significant depth differences between cfDNA and gDNA were mainly found in centromeric regions. While gDNA identified more variants with more uniform coverage, AF spectra, population structure, and genomic associations were largely consistent between the two DNA types. This study provides a detailed comparison of cfDNA and gDNA, highlighting the potential of cfDNA as an alternative to gDNA in genomic research. Our findings could serve as a reference for future studies on cfDNA and gDNA.","Zeng, Jingyu; Zhu, Huanhuan; Wang, Yu; Zeng, Guodan; Liu, Panhong; Ou, Rijing; Lan, Xianmei; Zheng, Yuhui; Zhao, Chenhui; Li, Linxuan; Zhang, Haiqiang; Yin, Jianhua; Liao, Mingzhi; Zhang, Yan; Jin, Xin","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Transomics Biotechnologies, BGI Research, Shenzhen 518083, China.; College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.; The Innovation Centre of Ministry of Education for Development and Diseases, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China.; Shanxi Medical University-BGI Collaborative Center for Future Medicine, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genome and Multi-Omics Technologies, BGI Research, Shenzhen518083, China.; College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.; BGI Research, Shenzhen 518083, China.",NAR genomics and bioinformatics,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Humans, Cell-Free Nucleic Acids, Genome-Wide Association Study, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Gene Frequency, Male, Female, Quantitative Trait Loci, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, DNA, Genomics, Genome, Human, Sequence Analysis, DNA",2025,09,09,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40918064,10.1093/nargab/lqaf119,40918064,0,0,NONE
40891323,Genomics correlates of brain metastasis and progression in colorectal cancer.,"Brain metastasis (BM) in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a rare event that undermines longevity and neurocognitive function. However, the molecular basis of BM in CRC is poorly understood. We analyzed next-generation sequencing (NGS) from patients with CRC to identify genomic features associated with BM and intracranial progression (IP). Patients with CRC who had NGS between 2014 and 2024 were included. Sequenced tumor specimens were classified by the anatomic site of biopsy as primary tumors (PT), extracranial metastases (EM), or BM. Sequenced PT specimens were compared to identify genomic differences between patients who did and did not develop BM. Among patients with BM, sequenced tumor specimens were compared to identify genomic differences by anatomic site. Sequenced BM samples were compared to identify genomic differences between patients who and did not experience IP after BM-directed local therapy. This analysis included 5526 with NGS of CRC, including 269 patients with BM. PT of patients who developed BM more frequently contained alterations in the KRAS, BRAF, and SMAD4, compared with PT of patients without BM. Among patients with BM, resected BM specimens had greater tumor mutation burden, fraction of genome altered, and frequency of TP53, SMAD4, and MYC alterations, compared with extracranial tumor specimens. Patients with BM carrying SMAD4 or PI3K pathway alterations showed a trend toward earlier IP after BM-directed therapy. This study identifies novel genomic associations with intracranial metastasis and progression in CRC, suggesting a potential basis for personalized clinical management.","Gui, Chengcheng; Walch, Henry S; Mueller, Kirin D; Boe, Lillian A; Skakodub, Anna; Miao, Emily; Khatri, Ishaani; Kumar, Rahul; Padilla Mazzeo, Michel; Shen, Junchao; Cooper, Claire; Parker, Mitchell; Hsu, Audree; Patel, Roshal R; Ilica, A Turan; Stember, Joseph N; Eichholz, Jordan E; Bou Nassif, Rabih; Yu, Kenny K H; Wilcox, Jessica A; Manca, Paolo; Yu, Yao; Yamada, Yoshiya; Imber, Brandon S; Maron, Steven B; Foote, Michael B; Chatila, Walid K; Yaeger, Rona; Schultz, Nikolaus; Pike, Luke R G","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY, USA 10065.; Department of Neurological Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY, USA 10065.; Oncologia Medica 1, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Via Venezian 1, Milan, Italy 20133.; Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY, USA 10065.; Marie-Josée and Henry R.

40796116,Characterization of a novel comprehensive genomic profiling test with better detection of heterozygous deletions and RNA-based gene fusion analysis.,"Cancer genomic profiling has revolutionized cancer research and clinical practice by facilitating personalized medicine approaches. Next-generation sequencing technologies have played a pivotal role in expanding the possibilities of cancer genomics, providing a comprehensive view of the genomic landscape of tumors and identifying potential therapeutic targets. In Japan, the approval of several cancer-related gene panel tests has accelerated the implementation of cancer genomic medicine. However, there remains a need for evidence-based selection criteria for the different panel tests available. Among these tests, ACTOnco+® stands out as a comprehensive cancer genomic profiling tool. In this study, we compared 110 samples from 29 different tumor types using FoundationOne® CDx (324 genes for DNA analysis) and ACTOnco+® (440 genes for DNA and 31 genes for RNA analysis). Overall, the mutation profiles between the 2 assays exhibited 82.8% positive agreement in reported sequence alterations in clinically actionable genes, including single nucleotide variants and insertions-deletions. Copy number gains showed concordance of 76.9%, and copy number losses in 66.7%. In the case of KIAA1549-BRAF fusion-positive astrocytoma, the fusion event was not detected by DNA only test, but RNA sequencing identified the rearrangement. The patient exhibited clinical benefit from MEK inhibitor treatment. Tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability (MSI) demonstrated high concordance across various cancer types. ACTOnco+® identified a total of 329 heterozygous deletions, which were subsequently validated for reliability using FISH analysis. Gene profiling with ACTOnco+® exhibited comparable results to FoundationOne® CDx, thereby contributing to future personalized medicine endeavors.","Kakuta, Ryouta; Takemoto, Akira; Tanimoto, Kousuke; Noji, Rika; Kudo, Ryo; Kano, Yoshihito; Ando, Yayoi; Simoi, Tatsunori; Kinugasa, Yusuke; Ikeda, Sadakatsu","Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Precision Cancer Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Research Core, Institute of Research, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.; Disease Biorepository Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Clinical Research Support Office, Research Management Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Oral Surgery, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.; Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, USA.; Department of Surgery, Kyoto Katsura Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.",The oncologist,Oncologist,"Humans, Neoplasms, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Genomics, Gene Fusion, Heterozygote, Female, Male",2025,08,11,2025,08,26,"NONE_NONE_ACT Genomics, Inc_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40796116,10.1093/oncolo/oyaf056,40796116,0,,

40825067,A chromosome-level Mitragyna parvifolia genome unveils spirooxindole alkaloid diversification and mitraphylline biosynthesis.,"Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) found in the Rubiaceae have varied pharmaceutical uses. Spirooxindole alkaloids are a structural subtype of MIAs with a unique spiro[pyrrolidine-3,3'-oxindole] ring system. Despite their intriguing structures and potent bioactivities, the evolution and diversification of spirooxindole alkaloids remain poorly understood. We report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of Mitragyna parvifolia, a tree species of the Rubiaceae family that predominantly produces the spirooxindole alkaloid mitraphylline. Comparative genomics, including comprehensive synteny and phylogeny analyses across the MIA-producing order Gentianales revealed a whole-genome duplication event underlying the divergence of the Cinchonoideae alliance from the Coffeeae alliance, leading to diversification of MIA biosynthesis. Transcriptome analyses of young and mature leaves, stems, stipules, and roots integrated with MIA profiling and genome analyses revealed several candidates in the MIA biosynthetic pathway. Functional characterization of selected candidates led to the elucidation of the biosynthesis of the antiproliferative spirooxindole mitraphylline in M. parvifolia. These genomic and transcriptomic resources are invaluable to identify the evolutionary origins and diversification of MIAs and spirooxindole alkaloids.","Laforest, Larissa C; Nguyen, Tuan-Anh M; Matsumoto, Gabriel Oliveira; Ramachandria, Pavithra; Chanderbali, Andre; Kanumuri, Siva Rama Raju; Sharma, Abhisheak; McCurdy, Christopher R; Dang, Thu-Thuy T; Nadakuduti, Satya Swathi","Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Research Computing, UF Information Technology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Environmental Horticulture Department, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.; Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.; Department of Horticultural Sciences, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.",The Plant cell,Plant Cell,"Phylogeny, Genome, Plant, Chromosomes, Plant, Indole Alkaloids, Biosynthetic Pathways, Transcriptome, Oxindoles, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Benzopyrans, Nitriles, Spiro Compounds",2025,08,18,2025,09,12,ALLRP 597402 - 24_NONE_NSERC-Alliance Collaboration_; NONE_NONE_UF ICBR PromethION Pilot_; R01 DA047855_DA_NIDA NIH HHS_United States; UG3 DA048353_DA_NIDA NIH HHS_United States; 2024-67013-42711_NONE_National Institute of Food and Agriculture_; SCH- 2020-0401_NONE_Michael Smith Health Research BC_; NONE_NONE_U.S. Department of Agriculture_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40825067,10.1093/plcell/koaf207,40825067,0,,
40913443,Haplotype-resolved genome and multi-omics landscape reveal an epigenetic regulation of citric acid accumulation in lemon.,"Lemon (Citrus limon L.), an economically important Citrus species, produces high levels of citric acid. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying citric acid accumulation in lemon fruit are poorly understood. In this study, we generated a haplotype-resolved genome for 'Eureka', a widely cultivated commercial lemon cultivar. Based on the progenitor sequences, we elucidated the origin and identified some domesticated loci of the lemon haplomes, including those associated with citric acid metabolism. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that the gene families enriched in the pathways related to stress responses and soluble sugar biosynthesis were dramatically contracted in the lemon genome. Substantial allelic variations in sequences, gene expression and methylation levels were detected between the two haplotypes. Of note, transcript levels of vacuolar P-ATPases, PH5, encoding a proton pump involved in citric acid accumulation, were drastically higher in Eureka lemon relative to sweet lemon, which contains trace amount of citric acid in the fruit. In addition, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that the promoter of PH5 was highly methylated in sweet lemon but not in Eureka. Furthermore, demethylation of the PH5 promoter led to an increase in the citric acid content. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that low DNA methylation level in the promoter region of PH5 contributes to the abundant accumulation of citric acid in lemon fruit. Our study provides a valuable genetic resource for investigating the domestication mechanism in citrus and underpins genome-based genetic engineering to create either acid or acidless cultivars.","Wang, Yue; Zeng, Yike; Wang, Yilei; Chen, Haowei; Xiao, Wei; Fang, Tian; Zhu, Jian; Li, Chunlong; Gao, Lei; Liu, Ji-Hong","Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Wuhan 430070, China.; National Key Laboratory for Germplasm Innovation & Utilization of Horticultural Crops, College of Horticulture and Forestry Science, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, PR China.; State Key Laboratory of Plant Diversity and Specialty Crops, Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430074, China.",Plant physiology,Plant Physiol,,2025,09,06,2025,09,06,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40913443,10.1093/plphys/kiaf400,40913443,0,0,NONE
40799348,An imaging genetics network model for clinical score assessment in Alzheimer's disease.,"Imaging genomics has recently emerged as a prominent focus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, showing great potential in predicting and diagnosing. In this paper, we propose a dual-stream imaging genetics network (DS-IGN) approach to AD clinical score assessment. DS-IGN is composed of two branches: one processes longitudinal data (neuroimaging) and the other handles static data (gene information). The imaging branch leverages hypergraphs to capture high-order relationships, constructing hypergraphs for samples and image features and performing weighted fusion. The genetic branch introduces an attention mechanism to adaptively adjust the weights of different genetic loci, which is particularly effective when multiple genes interact. By integrating both imaging and genetic features, DS-IGN effectively predicts patients' clinical scores in advance, providing early warnings of cognitive decline and supporting timely interventions to slow disease progression.","Sheng, Jinhua; Xin, Yu; Zhang, Qiao; Wang, Luyun; Wang, Binbing","Women's Health, National Center of Gerontology, 1 Dahua Road, Beijing 100730, China.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, China.; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Image Analysis for Sensory and Cognitive Health, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China, Xiasha Higher Education Zone, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310018, China.; Women's Health, Beijing Hospital, 1 Dahua Road, Beijing 100730, China.; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Beijing 100730, China.",PNAS nexus,PNAS Nexus,,2025,07,25,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40799348,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf234,40799348,0,,
40852424,Global survey of secondary metabolism in <i>Aspergillus niger</i> via activation of specific transcription factors.,"Genomics analysis confirmed the status of filamentous fungi as a rich source of novel secondary metabolites; however, the discovery of these compounds is hampered by the cryptic nature of their biosynthetic pathways under laboratory conditions. Consequently, despite substantial research effort over the past decades, much of the secondary metabolome remains uncharacterized in fungal organisms. Our manual curation of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the <i>Aspergillus niger</i> NRRL3 genome revealed that only 13 of 86 BGCs have had their cognate secondary metabolite products confirmed or reliably inferred. We also identified 60 transcription factors (TFs) associated with cryptic BGCs. To further characterize <i>A. niger</i> secondary metabolism, we created a collection of strains each overexpressing a single BGC-associated TF. We analyzed the strain collection using a standardized pipeline where we monitored phenotypic changes and compound production using mass spectrometry.

40844335,"Azithromycin, an Antimicrobial Agent, Targets Glycoside Hydrolase Family 35 and Exhibits Potent Curative Activity Against Tea Plants Diseases Caused by <i>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</i>.","Tea disease caused by <i>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</i> is an emerging fungal disease that significantly reduces the yield and quality of tea in tea-producing regions owing to the lack of effective control methods. In this study, we evaluated the antifungal activity of azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, against <i>L. theobromae</i>. In vitro assays demonstrated strong inhibitory activity, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 140.61 μg/ml, and in vivo application resulted in a 54.30% lesion inhibition rate at 800.0 μg/ml against tea leaf spot. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses using optical and transmission electron microscopy revealed that azithromycin induced pronounced hyphal abnormalities, including cytoplasmic disorganisation and membrane disruption. Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses indicated that azithromycin treatment led to systemic disruptions in <i>L. theobromae</i>, including dysregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein degradation, glycoprotein and cell wall biosynthesis, ergosterol biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and stress response pathways. Molecular docking and bioinformatic analyses identified glycoside hydrolase family 35 (GH35), a key protein in carbohydrate metabolism, as the principal target of azithromycin, exhibiting the most favourable binding energy of -7.9 kcal/mol. These findings demonstrate that azithromycin disrupts multiple metabolic and cellular processes in <i>L. theobromae</i>, primarily by targeting GH35, providing a robust multi-target approach for fungal inhibition and sustainable disease control strategies for tea cultivation.","Rehman, Atta Ur; Hamza, Muhammad Ameer; Xia, Chengyan; Xie, Wenjing; Wang, Delu; Chen, Zhuo","College of Forestry, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; dlwang@gzu.edu.cn.; State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticides, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Guizhou UniversityGuiyang, China, 550025; 17815337256@163.com.; Guizhou University, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Huaxi District, Guiyang, Guizhou Province of China, Guiyang, China, 550025; gychenzhuo@aliyun.com.; Guizhou University, State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, 2708 South Section of Huaxi Avenue, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, China, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, 550025; xiewj24@163.com.; Guizhou University, State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticides, State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticides, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, 550025; dmameerhamza@gmail.com.; Guizhou University, State Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide, Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, College of life sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, Guiyang, China, China, 550025; Attakundi9261@gmail.com.",Phytopathology,Phytopathology,,2025,08,22,2025,08,22,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40844335,10.1094/PHYTO-05-25-0190-R,40844335,0,0,NONE

In this study, 48 isolates of <i>P. griseola</i> from Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Honduras and Tanzania were sequenced (3RADseq), resulting in the de novo assembly of 42,214 contigs. Phylogenomic, population genetic structure and principal component analyses using 1,260 SNPs divided these isolates into two populations, Andean and Middle American, while the Middle American population was further divided into three sub-populations. There were moderate to high levels of differentiation between <i>P. griseola</i> populations, with pairwise Fst values ranging from 0.11 to 0.95. The Andean population was composed of isolates from Tanzania, and was separated from the Middle American population (Fst = 0.95). The Middle American population was separated into 3 subpopulations including isolates from: 1. Guatemala and Honduras, 2. Tanzania, and 3. Puerto Rico. Pathogenicity testing of 27 isolates from Puerto Rico, using 12 common bean differential lines, identified ten races, but these races were not associated with SNPs found in virulence genes.

40892695,Integrative Genomics and Phenotypic Profiling Reveal Lacticplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 as a Multifunctional Candidate for Dermatological Probiotic Development.,"Probiotics and postbiotics are recognized for their potential to benefit skin health, and complete genome analysis serves as a pivotal tool to accelerate the exploration of probiotic functionalities. To investigate this relationship, this study aimed to elucidate the skin-promoting potential of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BGI-N6 (BGI-N6) through integrated genomic analysis and phenotypic analysis. Results indicated that the high-precision complete genome of BGI-N6 comprises 3 257 641 bases with a 45% GC content and 3030 CDSs, involving multiple genes related to carbon source fermentation, gastrointestinal tolerance, and environmental adaptability. Notably, BGI-N6 possessed several bacteriostatic, antioxidant, and enzyme activity inhibition-related genes, which could encode the biosynthetic pathways of bacteriocins, glutathione/thioredoxin antioxidant systems, NADH peroxidase, catalase, and various organic acids. Supporting these genomic insights, in vitro experiments comparative evaluation revealed that BGI-N6 exhibited superior capabilities relative to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (299v) in antioxidant activity, inhibition of cutaneous pathogens growth, and suppression of skin-damaging enzyme (e.g., collagenase and elastase) activity. These effects were correlated with the production of lactic acid, 6-hydroxyhexanoate, coumarins, and other bioactive compounds by BGI-N6. The evidence from integrated genomic analysis and in vitro experiments established a critical theoretical foundation for the development of BGI-N6 as a candidate for probiotic and postbiotic applications targeting skin health.","Wang, Jinhong; Xu, Xiaowei; Wen, Yangfeng; Wei, Benliang; Chen, Junke; Cai, Sihang; Wang, Mengmeng; Wu, Zhinan; Liu, Yanhong; Zhang, Haifeng; Zhong, Yiyi; Zou, Yuanqiang","BGI Research, Shenzhen, China.; College of Pharmacy, Shenzhen Technology University, Shenzhen, China.; State Key Laboratory of Genome and Multi-Omics Technologies, BGI Research, Shenzhen, China.; College of Life Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.; College of Plant Protection, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.; College of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.; BGI Precision Nutrition, Shenzhen, China.; Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of Detection and Intervention of Human Intestinal Microbiome, BGI Research, Shenzhen, China.; College of Life Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,FASEB J,"Probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum, Genomics, Genome, Bacterial, Antioxidants, Skin, Animals, Bacteriocins, Phenotype",2025,08,28,2025,09,02,CY20241202124801003_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Agreement_; KCXFZ20240903094006009_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Agreement_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40892695,10.1096/fj.202501440R,,,,

While various factors have been studied for their prognostic significance, this study evaluated the potential prognostic value of the intrinsic disorder of T-cell receptor beta (TRB) polypeptides. TRB recombination sequencing reads were extracted from tumor RNA-seq files representing The Cancer Genome Atlas, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma dataset, and genomics files representing the National Institutes of Health, phs002683 dataset. Intrinsic disorder values were computed for the TRB V-complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3)-J amino acid sequences for all cases. Survival analyses assessed overall survival and disease-specific survival for case sets based on assigning cases to upper or lower 50th percentile groups, based in turn on intrinsic disorder values. For the phs002683 dataset, intrinsic disorder values were compared between cases representing resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and cases representing no observed resistance. The results indicated that the upper 50th percentile of the range of intrinsic disorder values was linked to better outcomes. This was obtained for two TRB datasets representing different RNA-seq file, recombination read extraction algorithms, and was observed for two different intrinsic disorder models. Furthermore, low minimum various long-3 and various short-long 2 values correlated with ICI treatment resistance. The findings of this study suggest that the diversity of intrinsic disorder values representing TRB V-CDR3-J assemblies may represent a novel prognostic biomarker for metastatic melanoma cases and a potential biomarker for indicating different personalized treatments.","Zhu, Joyce J; Sahoo, Arpan; Song, Joanna J; Vangala, Veda Naga Priya; Kapoor, Utsav; Blanck, George","Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida.; Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, USA.",Melanoma research,Melanoma Res,,2025,08,29,2025,08,29,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40880302,10.1097/CMR.0000000000001061,,,,

40894278,Gene and pathway analysis of genome-wide genetic associations of bladder cancer.,"Although genetic variants associated with bladder cancer (BCa) risk have been identified through hypothesis-driven and genome-wide association studies, a systematic understanding of BCa genetic susceptibility at the gene and pathway levels remains to be achieved. In this 2-stage functional genomics study, we used 5 independent tools for genome-wide gene mapping and ranking based on BCa genome-wide association studies summary statistics, followed by a meta-analysis of gene-level significance <i>p</i> values, to obtain a consensus gene ranking in terms of association with BCa. Subsequently, we performed preranked gene-set enrichment analysis to identify the functional pathways involved in BCa genetic susceptibility. Joint analysis with gene-set enrichment analysis, based on somatic alteration frequency, was performed to explore the pathway-level relationships between genetic susceptibility and somatic alterations in BCa. Other than the well-known BCa genes (such as <i>FGFR3</i>, <i>MYC</i>, <i>TERT</i>, <i>CCNE1</i>, and <i>TP63</i>), we additionally prioritized a set of novel genes likely to be genetically implicated in BCa development, including <i>SETD2</i>, a possible tumor suppressor gene involved in chromatin remodeling. We further demonstrated convergence between genetic associations and somatic alterations at both the gene (eg, <i>FGFR3</i> and <i>TERT</i>) and pathway levels (eg, cell cycle and chromatin modification), as well as functional ontologies specifically implicated in germline predisposition to BCa (eg, CD8/TCR signaling, immune checkpoints, and cytokine signaling). We identified several novel genes associated with BCa and demonstrated that genetic variants contribute to the development of BCa by affecting antitumor immunity, response to toxic exposure, and RNA and protein homeostasis and synergizing with somatic alterations in various cancer-related pathways.","Shi, Mingjun; Meng, Xiangyu; Xu, Xuan; Wang, Qiaoli","First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.; Department of Urology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Health Science Center, Hubei Minzu University, Enshi, China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Hubei Provincial Clinical Medical Research Center for Nephropathy, Hubei Minzu University, Enshi, China.",Current urology,Curr Urol,,2025,06,05,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894278,10.1097/CU9.0000000000000289,40894278,0,0,NONE

40826700,Identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of breast cancer using bioinformatics analysis.,"Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the most common neoplastic diseases among the female population. There were 43,780 BRCA-related deaths, with a mortality rate of 15% in the United States in 2022. Therefore, it is necessary to screen and validate potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers related to BRCA through bioinformatics technology. The GSE42568 and GSE5364 datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the Cancer Genome Atlas BRCA dataset was sourced from the Xena functional genomics platform. Differentially expressed genes were identified across these 3 BRCA datasets using Venn diagram software. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were carried to investigate the role of these genes and potential underlying mechanisms in BRCA. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database, and key genes were identified using the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape software. Hub genes were determined via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and were validated using the GEPIA, UALCAN platforms. In addition, the expression of these genes in tumor and adjacent tissues of BRCA patients was validated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A total of 84 overlapping differentially expressed genes were preliminarily screened at the initial stage, including 33 upregulated and 51 downregulated genes. The top 20 highly connected key genes were identified subsequently using Cytoscape software. These hub genes show good consistency with the progression of the BRCA. In addition, the results showed that the expression levels of these 5 hub genes are significantly different among BRCA subtypes, which may provide support for identifying BRCA subtypes and optimizing treatment strategies. Four hub genes (AURKA, DTL, NUSAP1, and RRM2) were finally identified through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. When compared to normal tissues, all of these genes exhibit high expression levels in BRCA tissues. The expression levels of AURKA, DTL, and RRM2 are positively correlated with NUSAP1, indicating a common regulatory relationship among these genes. Our present study demonstrated that AURKA, DTL, NUSAP1, and RRM2 are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BRCA, and may also be potential treatment targets for clinical implication in the future.","Zhang, Weiwei; Zhu, Min; Chen, Shen; Zhou, Changhui; Meng, Min; Yang, Yapei; Chen, Shuangfeng; Xu, Cong","Department of Clinical Laboratory, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China.; Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China.; Department of Central Laboratory, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China.",Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),"Humans, Breast Neoplasms, Female, Computational Biology, Biomarkers, Tumor, Protein Interaction Maps, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Prognosis, Gene Expression Profiling, Databases, Genetic, Kaplan-Meier Estimate",2025,08,18,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40826700,10.1097/MD.0000000000043973,40826700,0,,

Genetic data on depression and anxiety were sourced from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the FinnGen database, respectively. Meanwhile, datasets of the Epidemiological Network were employed to investigate thyroid nodules, flatulence, and menstrual irregularities. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted with the TwoSampleMR R package. To ensure the accuracy and detect horizontal pleiotropy, the inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, and weighted averaging were employed. Additionally, the Cochran Q heterogeneity test was applied to assess the heterogeneity. Moreover, the stability of the findings was assessed using the leave-one-out method. Finally, the supplementary MR and multivariate MR analyses were utilized to verify the consistency of the associations. Our analysis demonstrated that depression significantly influenced the development of thyroid nodules (P = .034, odds ratio = 1.75, confidence interval [1.0419, 2.9392]) and irregular menstruation (P = .02, odds ratio = 1.005, confidence interval [1.0008, 1.0097]) but had no effect on flatulence (P = .156). However, the inverse variance weighting P-values for anxiety in all outcomes showed no causal association with any of the studied conditions. MR analysis showed that depression causally worsens thyroid nodules and menstrual irregularities, while anxiety has no such association. Moreover, depression continuously impacts menstrual irregularities, even after anxiety adjustment.

This review explores the evolution of clinical genetics service delivery, highlighting evolving models of care designed to meet rising demand, improve access, and ensure equitable, patient-centered genomic care. Key models of care discussed include multidisciplinary team approaches, embedded genetic counselors, advanced practice providers, upskilled non-genetics specialists, laboratory-based genetics clinicians, primary care providers of genetic healthcare and automated/patient-directed models. Educational needs, funding and adjuncts such as genetic assistants, collaborative telegenetics, and digital tools are also discussed for their role in supporting sustainable implementation. We recommend health organizations develop a roadmap for genomic medicine through creation of a genomic medicine governance framework, assessment of workforce capacity, definition of patient cohorts, and reviewing their infrastructure readiness. No single model of care is suitable for every context. By clearly defining needs, acknowledging limitations, and identifying potential risks, organizations can select the most appropriate models to address both current and future requirements. As genomics becomes increasingly embedded in routine care, we believe a coordinated, evidence-based approach is essential to ensure well tolerated, effective, accessible, equitable, and sustainable delivery of genomic medicine across diverse healthcare settings.","Curd, Helen; Gorrie, Anita; Fennell, Andrew Paul","Monash Genetics, Monash Health.; Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.",Current opinion in pediatrics,Curr Opin Pediatr,,2025,08,20,2025,08,20,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40831355,10.1097/MOP.0000000000001502,40831355,0,,

40839792,Competency Framework Development for Genomics Nurse Educators: Defining a Specialty Role in Academic Nursing Education.,"As genomics becomes increasingly integral to health care, enhancing nurse educators' competence in teaching genomics is vital for sustaining nursing's role in precision health. Many nurses lack confidence in applying genomics in practice, highlighting the need for improved genomics nursing education. The International Society for Nurses in Genetics convened a steering committee to develop a competency framework defining the role of Genomics Nurse Educators. We applied the Six-Step Model for Competency Framework Development in Healthcare Professions, drawing on targeted literature review and international stakeholder input to draft the framework. The resulting framework includes 3 domains and 7 competency areas defining the knowledge, expertise, and leadership required for Genomics Nurse Educators. The framework advances genomic nursing education globally, transitioning it from an emerging to an evolving specialty; provides a structured pathway for faculty development, supports integration of genomics into curricula, and promotes education of genomics-informed nurses.","Himes, Deborah O; Dungan, Jennifer R; Dewell, Sarah; Davis, Sarah H; Ward, Linda D; Lucas, Ruth F","Author Affiliations: College of Nursing, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah (Dr Himes and Prof Davis); College of Nursing, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (Dr Dungan); School of Nursing, Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada (Dr Dewell); School of Nursing, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina (Dr Ward); and School of Nursing, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut (Dr Lucas).",Nurse educator,Nurse Educ,"Humans, Faculty, Nursing, Genomics, Nursing Education Research, Education, Nursing, Curriculum, Nurse's Role",2025,08,04,2025,08,22,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40839792,10.1097/NNE.0000000000001947,40839792,0,0,NONE
40839605,Ribosome profiling reveals that post-transcriptional control of Nalf1 by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is required for paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain.,"Sensory neurons are integral to the genesis and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The molecular mechanisms that mediate long-lived changes in their excitability are unclear. Here, we leverage functional genomics approaches to survey changes in RNA abundance and translation in dorsal root ganglion neurons from a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. We focus specifically on females as paclitaxel is a first-line therapy for breast cancer. The sequencing data indicate that substantially more changes occur at the level of translation (n = 404) than transcription and decay (n = 109). We discovered that a core subunit of the sodium leak channel (NALCN) channel, auxiliary factor 1 (NALF1), is preferentially translated in response to paclitaxel. This effect is mediated by the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNP L). Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L binds a 14 base CA-rich element (CARE) in the Nalf1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Genetic elimination of either HNRNP L, the Nalf1 CARE motif, or the pore-forming subunit of the nonselective NALCN diminishes pain amplification in vivo. Collectively, these results illustrate that an element situated in a 3'UTR is required for neuropathic pain in female mice.","de la Peña, June Bryan; García, Guadalupe; Campbell, Zachary T","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States.",Pain,Pain,"Animals, Paclitaxel, Neuralgia, Female, Mice, Ganglia, Spinal, Disease Models, Animal, Ribosomes, Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Ribosome Profiling",2025,04,02,2025,08,25,R01NS114018_NONE_NIH/NINDS_; R01 NS114018_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40839605,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000003577,40839605,0,0,NONE
40858258,Illuminating the mystery of thylacine extinction: a role for relaxed selection and gene loss.,"Gene loss shapes lineage-specific traits but is often overlooked in species survival. In this study, we investigate the role of ancestral gene loss using the extinction icon-thylacine (<i>Thylacinus cynocephalus</i>). While studies of neutral genetic variation indicate a population decline before extinction, the impact of thylacine-specific ancestral gene losses remains unexplored. The availability of a chromosomal-level genome of the extinct thylacine offers a unique opportunity for such comparative studies. Here, we leverage palaeogenomic data to compare gene presence/absence patterns between the Tasmanian devil and thylacine. We discovered ancestral (between 13-1 Ma) loss of <i>SAMD9L</i>, <i>HSD17B13</i>, <i>CUZD1</i> and <i>VWA7</i> due to multiple gene-inactivating mutations, corroborated by short-read sequencing. The timing of gene loss mirrors the thylacine's shift towards hypercarnivory and increased body size. Notably, the loss of <i>SAMD9</i> correlates with a carnivorous diet. Our genome-wide analysis reveals olfactory receptor loss and relaxed selection, aligning with reduced olfactory lobes in the thylacine, indicating olfaction is not its primary hunting sense. By integrating palaeogenomic data with comparative genomics, our study reveals ancestral gene losses and their impact on species survival and resilience to environmental changes. Our approach can be extended to other extinct and endangered species, helping to identify genetic factors for conservation efforts.","Salve, Buddhabhushan Girish; Vijay, Nagarjun","Computational Evolutionary Genomics Lab, Department of Biological Sciences, IISER Bhopal, Bhauri, Madhya Pradesh, India.",Proceedings.

40904107,Lineage-specific defence systems of pandemic <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>.,"Cholera remains a significant global health burden. The causative agent responsible for the ongoing cholera pandemic, which began in 1961, is the seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Over the past century, lineages of <i>V. cholerae</i> have been traced using phage typing schemes, DNA hybridization on microarrays and, more recently, comparative genomics enabled by next-generation sequencing. Such lineage tracing has provided essential insights into cholera transmission dynamics. Beyond their use as tools in typing schemes, phages have long been recognized as major players in cholera epidemiology. Importantly, the integration of comparative genomics, epidemiology and molecular studies has recently provided compelling evidence that bacterial defence systems, along with the evolutionary adaptations of phages to counteract them, play critical roles in the ongoing arms race between pandemic <i>V. cholerae</i> and their phages, with phage resistance likely influencing cholera epidemiology. In this review, we explore abundant and sporadic defence systems in sub-lineages of 7PET <i>V. cholerae</i> and describe how they protect their bacterial hosts from predatory phages. Additionally, we contrast these findings with the defence activities observed in the sixth pandemic classical lineage of <i>V. cholerae</i>. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges and limitations associated with studying defence systems in <i>V. cholerae</i> and propose future directions to advance research in this field.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of bacterial immune systems'.","Blokesch, Melanie; Seed, Kimberley D","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, Global Health Institute, School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Despite their ecological significance and unique biological attributes, genomic information for peritrichs has remained sparse. This study aimed to fill this gap by sequencing the genomes of seven distinct species of peritrich ciliates and employing advanced genomic technologies to investigate their metabolic characteristics, functional diversity and evolutionary relationships. Our analyses revealed a large number of genes annotated across various functional categories, with EggNOG annotations highlighting genes related to post-translational modification, translation and energy metabolism, suggesting a high adaptive and metabolic capacity. Notably, the diversity of CAZymes, particularly glycoside hydrolases, indicates metabolic complexity and the ability to degrade carbohydrates, critical for environmental adaptation and bacterial predation. Additionally, the presence of chitin-degrading enzymes in species like <i>Trichodina acuta</i> points to complex ecological interactions with hosts, with potential implications for natural ecosystems and commercial hatcheries. A concentration of glycosyl transferases found in the Vaginicolidae family suggests an enhanced capacity for glycoconjugate synthesis, possibly linked to lorica formation. The phylogenomic reconstruction was consistent with existing literature, uncovering intricate phylogenetic relationships. Overall, our findings significantly advance the understanding of peritrich ciliates by shedding light on their metabolic potential, ecological adaptability and evolutionary complexity, while also providing a genomic foundation for future ecological and evolutionary studies.","de Souza, Pedro Mendes; Cedrola, Franciane; Pedroso Dias, Roberto Júnio; Solferini, Vera Nisaka","Laboratório de Protozoologia, Departamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.; Laboratório de Diversidade Genética, Departamento de Genética, Evolução, Microbiologia e Imunologia, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.; Center for Computational Engineering and Sciences, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.",Microbial genomics,Microb Genom,"Genomics, Ciliophora, Phylogeny, Genome, Protozoan, Oligohymenophorea",2025,09,04,2025,09,06,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905408,10.1099/mgen.0.001472,40905408,0,0,NONE
40889132,Genomic resistance in historical clinical isolates increased in frequency and mobility after the age of antibiotics.,"Antibiotic resistance is frequently observed shortly after the clinical introduction of an antibiotic. Whether and how frequently that resistance occurred before the introduction is harder to determine, as isolates could not have been tested for resistance before an antibiotic was discovered. Historical collections, like the British National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC), stretching back to 1885, provide a window into this history. Here, we match 1,817 sequenced high-quality genomes from the NCTC collection to their respective year of isolation to study resistance genes before and concurrent with the age of antibiotics. Concordant with previous work, we find resistance genes in both pathogens and environmental samples before the age of antibiotics. While generally rare before the introduction of an antibiotic, we find an associated increase in frequency with antibiotic introduction. Finally, we observe a trend of resistance elements becoming both increasingly mobile and nested within multiple mobile elements as time goes on. More broadly, our findings suggest that likely functional antibiotic resistance genes were circulating in clinically relevant isolates before the age of antibiotics, but human usage is associated with increasing both their overall prevalence and mobility.","Kaul, Arya; Souque, Célia; Holland, Mische; Baym, Michael","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, USA.; Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Microbiology and Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.",Microbial genomics,Microb Genom,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Humans, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Genome, Bacterial, Bacteria, Genomics, Interspersed Repetitive Sequences",2025,08,30,2025,09,10,T32 HG002295_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM133700_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40889132,10.1099/mgen.0.001474,40889132,0,0,NONE
40794526,Comparative genomics of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> reveals a conserved genome architecture and novel virulence-related gene clusters.,"Bacteria from the species <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> encompass a diverse range of phenotypes. While some strains are used as probiotics, others have been isolated from cases of botulism and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm neonates. We identify a unique genomic feature of this species, namely a highly conserved extrachromosomal element of ~0.8 Mb. This replicon satisfies the three principal criteria used to define a chromid, which include the possession of core genes that are encoded on the main chromosome in other species. Although <i>C. butyricum</i> is the type species of <i>Clostridium</i>, we find that the possession of a chromid is not a typical feature of members of this genus and represents a unique genomic fingerprint of the species <i>C. butyricum</i>. Furthermore, we show that pathogenic <i>C. butyricum</i> strains from the sequenced examples are not monophyletic, which suggests that virulence has evolved multiple times from related non-pathogenic ancestors. However, we were able to identify common genes which are found exclusively in these pathogenic strains. In addition to the botulinum neurotoxin genes, these include a novel set of genes involved in the biosynthesis of a capsular polysaccharide (CPS), and genes that confer the ability to utilize the mucin-derived sugar l-fucose, which may provide a competitive advantage for growth in the colon. Moreover, by identifying NEC strain-associated virulence factors, we are able to further the understanding of these particularly harmful strains.","Anderson, Orlagh H; Chong, James P J; Thomas, Gavin H","Department of Biology, University of York, Wentworth Way, York, YO10 5DD, UK.",Microbial genomics,Microb Genom,"Clostridium butyricum, Genome, Bacterial, Virulence, Multigene Family, Genomics, Humans, Phylogeny",2025,08,07,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40794526,10.1099/mgen.0.001477,40794526,0,,

To precisely characterize the outbreak, we performed extensive genomic investigation, including both short- and long-read sequencing technologies, combined with bioinformatics analysis. This genomic approach enabled us to identify the putative source of the outbreak and understand the transmission dynamics of this opportunistic pathogen within the hospital. Our investigation revealed a complex, polyclonal contamination pattern traced to contaminated hospital laundry. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis identified multiple <i>B. cereus</i> sequence types (STs) in both clinical and environmental samples, with three predominant STs (ST-2184, ST-163 and ST-365) found in both. These STs, previously implicated in bloodstream infection (BSI) outbreaks, raise concerns about their potential as healthcare-associated pathogens. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis provided strong evidence linking human and environmental isolates, with close genetic relatedness observed between isolates from patients and those from laundered scrubs, transport trucks and bed linens. The study highlights the potential for laundry-mediated pathogen transmission in healthcare settings and underscores the importance of stringent laundry hygiene practices.

This study aimed to analyse the global genetic diversity of <i>M. catarrhalis</i> using whole-genome sequencing to identify phylogenetic lineages, antimicrobial resistance patterns and key virulence factors. Phylogenomic analysis of 345 publicly available genomes identified 3 phylogroups, of which 1 exhibited significant genomic divergence and was excluded from further analyses due to its potential classification as a separate species. The remaining two phylogroups corresponded to previously described seroresistant and serosensitive lineages. Phylogroup B exhibited a higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes, particularly <i>bro-1</i> and <i>bro-2</i>, while phylogroup A exhibited unique metabolic adaptation, including genes encoding for the DppB-DppC-DppD dipeptide transport system. Both phylogroups shared crucial virulence factors, including UspA1 and UspA2, which facilitate adhesion and immune evasion. Potential therapeutic targets were identified, including PilQ, essential for type IV pilus biogenesis, and CopB, which plays a key role in iron acquisition and immune evasion.

40777424,The Impact of Tokenizer Selection in Genomic Language Models.,"Genomic language models have recently emerged as a new method to decode, interpret, and generate genetic sequences. Existing genomic language models have utilized various tokenization methods, including character tokenization, overlapping and non-overlapping k-mer tokenization, and byte-pair encoding, a method widely used in natural language models. Genomic sequences differ from natural language because of their low character variability, complex and overlapping features, and inconsistent directionality. These features make sub-word tokenization in genomic language models significantly different from both traditional language models and protein language models. This study explores the impact of tokenization in genomic language models by evaluating their downstream performance on forty-four classification fine-tuning tasks. We also perform a direct comparison of byte pair encoding and character tokenization in Mamba, a state-space model. Our results indicate that character tokenization outperforms sub-word tokenization methods on tasks that rely on nucleotide level resolution, such as splice site prediction and promoter detection. While byte-pair tokenization had stronger performance on the SARS-CoV-2 variant classification task, we observed limited statistically significant differences between tokenization methods on the remaining downstream tasks.","Lindsey, LeAnn M; Pershing, Nicole L; Habib, Anisa; Dufault-Thompson, Keith; Stephens, W Zac; Blaschke, Anne J; Jiang, Xiaofang; Sundar, Hari","Department of Computer Science, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Utah, SLC, UT, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Utah, SLC, UT, USA.; Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah, SLC, UT, USA.; National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,26,2025,09,14,K12 TR004413_TR_NCATS NIH HHS_United States; UM1 TR004409_TR_NCATS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777424,10.1101/2024.09.09.612081,40777424,0,,
40894641,Pre-training Genomic Language Model with Variants for Better Modeling Functional Genomics.,"Sequence-to-function models can predict gene expression from sequence data and be used to link genetic information with transcriptomics data to understand regulatory processes and their effects on complex phenotypes. The genomic language models are pre-trained with large-scale DNA sequences and can generate robust representations of these sequences by learning the genomic context. However, few studies can estimate the predictability of gene expression levels and bridge these two classes of models together to explore individualized gene expression prediction. In this manuscript, we propose UKBioBERT as a DNA language model pre-trained with genetic variants from UK BioBank. We demonstrate that UKBioBERT generates informative embeddings capable of identifying gene functions, and improving gene expression prediction in cell lines, thereby enhancing our understanding of gene expression predictability. Building upon these embeddings, we combine UKBioBERT with state-of-the-art sequence-to-function architectures, Enformer and Borzoi, to create UKBioFormer and UKBioZoi. These models exhibit better performance in predicting highly predictable gene expression levels and can be generalized across different cohorts. Furthermore, UKBioFormer effectively captures the relationship between genetic variants and expression variations, enabling in-silico mutation analyses and eQTL identification.

40791428,Orthogonal chemical genomics approaches reveal genomic targets for increasing anaerobic chemical tolerance in <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i>.,"Genetically-engineered microbes have the potential to increase efficiency in the bioeconomy by overcoming growth-limiting production stress. Screens of gene perturbation libraries against production stressors can identify high-value engineering targets, but follow-up experiments needed to guard against false positives are slow and resource-intensive. In principle, the use of orthogonal gene perturbation approaches could increase recovery of true positives over false positives because the strengths of one technique compensate for the weaknesses of the other, but, in practice, two parallel screens are rarely performed at the genome-scale. Here, we screen genome-scale CRISPRi (CRISPR interference) knockdown and TnSeq (transposon insertion sequencing) libraries of the bioenergy-relevant Alphaproteobacterium, <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i>, against growth inhibitors commonly found in deconstructed plant material. Integrating data from the two gene perturbation techniques, we established an approach for defining engineering targets with high specificity. This allowed us to identify all known genes in the cytochrome <i>bc</i> <sub>1</sub> and cytochrome <i>c</i> synthesis pathway as potential targets for engineering resistance to phenolic acids under anaerobic conditions, a subset of which we validated using precise gene deletions. Strikingly, this finding is specific to the cytochrome <i>bc</i> <sub>1</sub> and cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway and does not extend to other branches of the electron transport chain. We further show that exposure of <i>Z. mobilis</i> to ferulic acid causes substantial remodeling of the cell envelope proteome, as well as the downregulation of TonB-dependent transporters.

Our approach enables high-throughput screening of LRR receptor-ligand combinations and provides a computational framework for engineering plant immune systems.","Stevens, Danielle M; Yang, David; Liang, Tatiana J; Li, Tianrun; Vega, Brandon; Coaker, Gitta L; Krasileva, Ksenia","Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720, USA.; Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, Davis CA 95616, USA.; Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley CA 94720, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,15,2025,09,14,R35 GM136402_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; DP2 AT011967_AT_NCCIH NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40791437,10.1101/2025.07.11.664399,40791437,0,,
40791427,Cell type-specific master metabolic regulators of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits metabolic heterogeneity; yet, the consequences on metabolic dynamics in a cell-type-specific manner and the underlying metabolite-sensor network basis remain unclear. Here, we show that neurons exhibit a striking decrease in energy and lipid-related metabolic activity, contrasted by an increase in microglial metabolism associated with neuroinflammation. To identify cell-type specific master metabolic regulators of AD underlying the metabolic alterations in AD, we introduce scFUMES (<b>s</b>ingle <b>c</b>ell <b>FU</b>nctional <b>ME</b>tabolite-<b>S</b>ensor), an algorithm integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, interactomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics from human brain biobanks. Applied to two AD-vulnerable regions (middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), scFUMES uncovers hundreds of AD-associated regulators, with neurons and microglia showing the most interactions. Particularly, scFUMES pinpoints genetics-informed master metabolic regulators across AD severity, sex and <i>APOE</i> genotype (e.g., PPARD-glycerol in microglia). Experimental testing reveals that two interaction pairs predicted by scFUMES, neuronal palmitic acid bound fatty acid binding protein 3 and gut metabolite indole-3-propionic acid binding to kynurenine aminotransferase 1, both lower pathological tau species in AD. Collectively, scFUMES systematically maps AD master metabolic regulators, offering insights into cellular metabolic heterogeneity and therapeutic strategies for AD and other AD-related dementia if broadly applied.","Qiu, Yunguang; Hou, Yuan; Wetzel, Liam; Caldwell, Jessica Z K; Zhu, Xiongwei; Pieper, Andrew A; Liu, Tian; Cheng, Feixiong","Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Las Vegas, NV 89106, USA.; Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Cleveland Clinic Genome Center, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.; Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Geriatric Psychiatry, GRECC, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center; Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Institute for Transformative Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland 44106, OH, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,17,2025,09,14,R01 AG066707_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; RF1 NS133812_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; U01 AG073323_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; I01 BX005976_BX_BLRD VA_United States; P30 AG072959_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG086365_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R56 AG074001_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG084250_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG082118_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R21 AG083003_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R03 AG084948_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG076448_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; RF1 AG082211_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40791427,10.1101/2025.07.11.664443,40791427,0,,
40791480,A multi-omics analysis of human fibroblasts overexpressing an <i>Alu</i> transposon reveals widespread disruptions in aging-associated pathways.,"During aging and cellular senescence, repetitive elements are frequently transcriptionally derepressed across species and cell types. Among these, the most abundant repeats by copy number in the human genome are <i>Alu</i> retrotransposons. Though <i>Alu</i> elements are often studied for their mutagenic potential, there is increasing appreciation for their contributions to other biological functions, including pro-inflammatory signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, a comprehensive analysis of <i>Alu</i>-driven molecular changes remains to be conducted, and <i>Alu</i>'s potential contributions to aging features remain incompletely characterized. Here, we show that overexpression of an <i>AluJb</i> transposon in human primary IMR-90 fibroblasts leads to large-scale alterations across the transcriptome, cellular proteome, and secretome. Functional genomics analyses reveal alterations in aging/senescence pathways, broadly, and mitochondrial metabolism, proteostasis, cell cycle, and extracellular matrix pathways, more specifically. Our results demonstrate that <i>Alu</i> transcriptional upregulation is sufficient to drive widespread disruptions to cellular homeostasis that mirror aging-associated alterations.","Bravo, Juan I; Tewelde, Eyael; King, Christina D; Bons, Joanna; Shah, Samah; Rose, Jacob; Campisi, Judith; Schilling, Birgit; Benayoun, Bérénice A","Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.; Alfred E.

40791346,Programmed DNA elimination drives rapid genomic innovation in two thirds of all bird species.,"Bird genomes are among the most stable in terms of synteny and gene content across vertebrates. However, germline-restricted chromosomes (GRCs) represent a striking exception where programmed DNA elimination confines large-scale genomic changes to the germline. GRCs are known to occur in songbirds (oscines), but have been studied only in a few species of Passerides such as the zebra finch, the key model for passerine genomics. Their presence and evolutionary dynamics in most major passerine lineages remain largely unexplored, with suboscines entirely unexamined by cytogenetic or genomic methods. Here, we present the most comprehensive comparative analysis of GRCs to date, spanning 44 million years of passerine evolution. By generating the first germline reference genomes of an oscine and a suboscine, 22 novel germline draft genomes spanning nearly all major passerine lineages and a germline draft genome of a parrot outgroup, we show that the GRC is likely present in 6,700 passerine species. Our results reveal that the GRC evolves rapidly and distinctly from the standard A chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes), yet retains functionally important, selectively maintained genes. We observed gene and repeat turnover occuring orders of magnitude faster than on the A chromosomes. Some GRC genes, such as <i>cpeb1</i> and <i>pim1</i>, are widespread from an ancient duplication. In contrast, other GRC genes, like <i>mfsd2b</i> and <i>bmp15</i>, have been independently duplicated onto the GRC multiple times, suggesting adaptive constraints. The discovery of <i>zglp1</i> on the zebra finch GRC, initially copied from chromosome 30 and subsequently lost from it, indicates functional replacement, where the GRC permits gene loss from the standard genome. As the GRC harbors the only <i>zglp1</i> copy in most of the ~4000 Passerides species, GRC loss would compromise essential germline functions. Our findings establish the GRC as a genomic innovator driving rapid germline evolution. This fact highlights its evolutionary significance for passerine diversification and suggests that programmed DNA elimination may be an overlooked yet phylogenetically widespread mechanism in many understudied animal lineages.","Ruiz-Ruano, Francisco J; Schlebusch, Stephen A; Vontzou, Niki; Moreno, Hugo; Biegler, Matthew T; Kutschera, Verena E; Ekman, Diana; Borges, Inês; Pei, Yifan; Rossini, Roberto; Albrecht, Tomas; Boman, Jesper; Borodin, Pavel; Burri, Reto; Cain, Kristal E; Forstmeier, Wolfgang; Frankl-Vilches, Carolina; Gahr, Manfred; Griffith, Simon C; Hill, Amy M; Irestedt, Martin; Joseph, Leo; Jønsson, Knud A; Kawakami, Takeshi; Kempenaers, Bart; Malinovskaya, Lyubov; Mueller, Jakob C; de Oliveira, Edivaldo H C; Palacios-Gimenez, Octavio M; Palinauskas, Vaidas; Qvarnström, Anna; Reifova, Radka; Ridl, Jakub; Segami, J Carolina; Tan, David J X; Torgasheva, Anna; Whibley, Annabel; Suh, Alexander","Department of Bioinformatics and Genetics, Swedish Museum of Natural History, Sweden.; Novosibirsk State University, Russia.; State Scientific Research Institute Nature Research Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania.; Department of Organismal Biology, Systematic Biology (EBC), Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden.; Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia.; Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, Australia.; Instituto de Ciências Exatas e Naturais, Universidade Federal do Pará, Belém, PA, Brazil.; Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Czech Republic.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.; Bragato Research Institute, Lincoln, New Zealand.; Embark Veterinary, Inc., USA.; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Leipzig 04103, Germany.; Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden, Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm University, Sweden.; Bonn Institute for Organismal Biology - Animal Biodiversity, University of Bonn, Germany.; Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, Norway.; Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language, The Rockefeller University, USA.; Australian National Wildlife Collection, National Research Collections Australia, CSIRO, Australia.; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic.; Population Ecology Group, Institute of Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution, Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany.; Seção de Meio Ambiente, Instituto Evandro Chagas, Ananindeua, PA, Brazil.; Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.; Department of Biology and Museum of Southwestern Biology, University of New Mexico, USA.; Department of Behavioural Neurobiology, Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence, Germany.; Department of Ecology and Genetics, Uppsala University, Sweden.; Centre for Molecular Biodiversity Research, Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change, Museum Koenig Bonn, Germany.; Swiss Ornithological Institute, Switzerland.; School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, UK.; Department of Biology, Duke University, USA.; Department of Ornithology, Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence, Germany.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,18,2025,09,14,K99 HG014014_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40791346,10.1101/2025.07.16.664580,40791346,0,,

40777289,The yEvo Mutation Browser: Enhancing student understanding of experimental evolution and genomics through interactive data visualization.,"Experimental evolution is a powerful method for studying the relationship between genotype and phenotype by observing how populations genetically adapt to controlled selective pressures. In educational settings, this approach also offers a dynamic way for students to engage with molecular genetics. One such educational effort, known as ""yEvo"" (yeast evolution), introduces experimental evolution into high school classrooms, allowing students to evolve the baker's yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under various stressors and investigate the resulting <i>de novo</i> genetic changes. While the hands-on experiments have been successful in fostering student interest and understanding of evolution, the downstream data analysis-interpreting whole-genome sequencing results of evolved yeast compared to the ancestor-remains a challenge. Students often struggle to grasp the significance of their mutated genes and lack the broader context to determine which mutations are most phenotypically relevant. To address these issues, we developed the yEvo Mutation Browser, an intuitive web tool designed to assist students and researchers alike in visualizing and contextualizing genome sequencing data. Developed using R Shiny, this tool features an interactive chromosome map displaying mutated genes, graphs categorizing mutation types, and a gene viewer illustrating specific mutation sites within genes. The app also features an option for non-yEvo-affiliated users to upload their own experimental evolution or genetic screen datasets and compare them with all yEvo data collected since 2018. The yEvo Mutation Browser streamlines data interpretation, helping students understand how organisms employ diverse genetic strategies to adapt to environmental stress. In the future, this framework could be adapted for use with other model organisms, offering a valuable resource for both genetics research and education.","Anderson, Leah; Schoch, Jasmine; Anastasia, Eleftheria; Wang, Virginia; Zeng, Zilong; Gorjifard, Sayeh; Dunham, Maitreya J","Department of Computer Science, University of Washington; Seattle, WA 98195, USA.; Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington; Seattle, WA 98195, USA.; Current address: Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine; Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,22,2025,09,14,R25 GM154336_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; T32 HG000035_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777289,10.1101/2025.07.18.665463,40777289,0,,

The frequency and diversity of ecDNA has been catalogued in adult and some childhood cancers; however, its role in most pediatric cancers is not well-understood. To address this gap, we accessed large pediatric cancer genomics data repositories and identified ecDNA from whole genome sequencing data using cloud computing. This retrospective cohort comprises 3,631 solid tumor biopsies from 2,968 patients covering all major childhood solid tumor types. Aggressive tumor types had particularly high incidences of ecDNA. Pediatric patients whose tumors harbored extrachromosomal DNA had significantly poorer five-year overall survival than children whose tumors contained only chromosomal amplifications. We catalogue known and potentially novel oncogenes recurrently amplified on ecDNA and show that ecDNA often evolves during disease progression.

40777255,Novel Spatial-Structural-Zero-Aware Dissimilarity Measures for Subtype Discovery Using Single Cell Hi-C Data.,"High-throughput single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies have opened new avenues for investigating cell-to-cell variability in the three-dimensional organization of the genome within individual nuclei. Despite their potential, analyses of scHi-C data are hindered by data sparsity, which varies substantially across cells. To address this challenge, recent methods aim to denoise scHi-C data and differentiate between two types of zero entries: structural zeros (SZs), which reflect true absence of contacts due to biological structure, and dropouts (DOs), which arise from insufficient sequencing depth. However, current dissimilarity measures used in downstream analyses, such as Euclidean distance and Kendall's tau, treat all zeros as equivalent, thus do not distinguish between SZs and DOs nor recognize the special role of SZs in capturing cell-to-cell variability. Such oversight limits the ability to accurately capture biologically meaningful differences between cells. In this study, we introduce structural-zeros-aware Kendall's tau (szKendall), a novel dissimilarity metric that explicitly incorporates the spatial structure of 2D contact matrices and leverages the presence or absence of shared SZs across cells. Through comprehensive simulations and analysis of real scHi-C datasets, we demonstrate that szKendall more effectively captures key structural features and achieves superior performance in cell clustering tasks compared to existing approaches. Our results underscore the importance of SZ-aware dissimilarity measures in advancing single-cell 3D genomics.","Liu, Yongqi; Jin, Victor; Lin, Shili",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,27,2025,08,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777255,10.1101/2025.07.23.666407,40777255,0,,
40777251,SCD1 and SCD5 Modulate PARP-Dependent DNA Repair via Fatty Acid Desaturation in Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) relies on fatty acid metabolism to sustain its aggressive growth. While the role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in GBM is established, the function of its brain-enriched isoform, SCD5, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that SCD5 is essential for glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) maintenance and genomic stability, with elevated expression in GSCs that declines upon differentiation, underscoring its role in tumor initiation. Through shotgun lipidomics, <sup>13</sup>C metabolic flux analysis, and functional genomics, we reveal that SCD1 and SCD5 play non-redundant roles in fatty acid desaturation, with SCD5 preferentially desaturating C18:0 and uniquely contributing to sphingolipid remodeling. Genetic silencing of either isoform disrupts cell cycle progression, impairs DNA damage repair, and reduces GSC viability, while SCD5 knockdown significantly extends survival in orthotopic GBM models. Mechanistically, loss of SCD activity or saturated fatty acid accumulation triggers PARP1 hyperactivation and subsequent degradation, depleting RAD51 to compromise homologous recombination and induce parthanatos. These findings uncover a lipid-mediated vulnerability in GBM, linking fatty acid desaturation to PARP1-dependent genome integrity. Targeting SCD5 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to eliminate therapy-resistant GSCs and enhance the efficacy of genotoxic or immunotherapeutic interventions.","Mnatsakanyan, Hayk; Sammarco, Alessandro; Awwad, Rami; Hewett, Abigail; Roumieh, Elie; Pechdimaljian, Caline; Azar, Yana; Pradhan, Richa; Su, Baolong; Williams, Kevin J; Bensinger, Steven J; Badr, Christian E","UCLA Lipidomics Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Biological Chemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Neuroscience Program, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,07,27,2025,09,14,R01 NS113822_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; P50 CA165962_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777251,10.1101/2025.07.23.666454,40777251,0,,
40799600,Allele-Specific Effects of Mutations in the Rifampin Resistance-Determining Region (RRDR) of RpoB on Physiology and Antibiotic Resistance in <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>.,"<i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is a member of the human gut microbiota that has evolved into a problematic nosocomial pathogen and leading cause of infections in hospitalized patients. Treatment of <i>E. faecium</i> infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance, making it important to understand resistance mechanisms and their broader consequences in this pathogen. Here we explored the collateral effects of rifampin resistance-associated mutations in the <i>E. faecium</i> RNA polymerase β-subunit (RpoB). Of 14,384 publicly available <i>E. faecium</i> genomes, nearly one-third carried a mutation in the rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) of RpoB. In a local population of 710 <i>E. faecium</i> clinical isolates collected from patients at a single hospital, we found significant associations between the presence of RRDR mutations and prior exposure to rifamycin antibiotics, as well as associations between RRDR mutations and altered daptomycin susceptibility. To investigate the phenotypic impacts of RRDR mutations, we generated and studied four isogenic strains with distinct RRDR mutations (Q473K, G482D, H486Y, S491L) that overlapped with clinical isolate variants. Transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses revealed allele-specific effects on <i>E. faecium</i> gene expression, growth dynamics, antibiotic susceptibility, isopropanol tolerance, and cell wall physiology.

40832282,GHIST 2024: The 1st Genomic History Inference Strategies Tournament.,"Evaluating population genetic inference methods is challenging due to the complexity of evolutionary histories, potential model misspecification, and unconscious biases in self-assessment. The Genomic History Inference Strategies Tournament (GHIST) is a community-driven competition designed to evaluate methods for inferring evolutionary history from population genomic data. The inaugural GHIST competition ran from July to November 2024 and featured four demographic history inference challenges of varying complexity: a bottleneck model, a split with isolation model, a secondary contact model with demographic complexity, and an archaic admixture model. Data were provided as error-free VCF files, and participants submitted numerical parameter estimates that were scored by relative root mean squared error. Approximately 60 participants competed, using diverse approaches. Results revealed the current dominance of methods based on site frequency spectra, while highlighting the advantages of flexible model-building approaches for complex demographic histories. We discuss insights regarding the competition and outline the next iteration, which is ongoing with expanded challenge diversity. By providing standardized benchmarks and highlighting areas for improvement, GHIST represents a substantial step toward more reliable inference of evolutionary history from genomic data.","Struck, Travis J; Vaughn, Andrew H; Daigle, Austin; Ray, Dylan D; Noskova, Ekaterina; Sequeira, Jaison J; Antonets, Svetlana; Alekseevskaya, Elizaveta; Grigoreva, Elizaveta; Raines, Evgenii; McMaster, Eilish S; Kovacs, Toby G L; Ragsdale, Aaron P; Moreno-Estrada, Andrés; Lotterhos, Katie E; Siepel, Adam; Gutenkunst, Ryan N","Unidad de Genómica Avanzada (UGA-LANGEBIO), Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del IPN (Cinvestav), Guanajuato, México.; Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland.; Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.; Department of Applied Zoology, Mangalore University, Karnataka, India.; Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, Russia.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, Northeastern University Marine Science Center, Nahant, Massachusetts, USA.; Simons Center for Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland.; Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Genotek Ltd., Moscow, Russia.; Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; ITMO University, St. Petersburg, Russia.; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.; School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Camperdown, Australia.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,11,2025,09,10,R35 GM149235_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; T32 GM067553_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832282,10.1101/2025.08.05.668560,40832282,0,,

Large amounts of existing srGS data remain under-analyzed for clinically relevant CNVs. During a collaborative Hackathon, we developed and applied scalable CNV analysis workflows to srGS data from three unsolved, exome-negative, rare disease cohorts: Primary Immunodeficiency (N = 39), Turkish developmental disorders (N = 31), and data from the Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases (GREGoR) (N = 1437). We employed Parliament2 for structural variant (SV) calling, Mosdepth and SLMSuite for read-depth-based quality control and CNV detection, and R Shiny-based visualization tools. We also constructed an SV/CNV variant database with population frequency and pathogenicity annotations, applied DBSCAN clustering for internal allele frequency estimation, and used a 3-way annotation strategy to aid interpretation. Our pipelines identified high-confidence CNVs and streamlined interpretation across cohorts. Within 2 days, the Hackathon yielded 39 candidate pathogenic SVs. The tools and workflows enabled rapid filtering, prioritization, and visualization of clinically relevant variants. This community-driven effort demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scalable CNV analysis for accelerating diagnosis and discovery in rare disease cohorts using srGS data.","Lun, Ming Yin; Posey, Jennifer E; Bengtsson, Jesse D; Du, Haowei; Roy, Rituparna Sinha; Yang, Lei; Ochoa, Sebastian; Yuan, Bo; Gillentine, Maddie; Lindstrand, Anna; Carvalho, Claudia M B",,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,medRxiv,,2025,08,12,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832433,10.1101/2025.08.08.25333317,40832433,0,,

We determined the molecular effects of E2 concentrations spanning six orders of magnitude (1 pM to 100 nM) in breast cancer cells. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) enhancers formed at low physiological doses of E2 (1-100 pM) are mechanistically distinct from those that form at high pharmacological doses (10-100 nM). They (1) form in open chromatin bound by FOXA1, (2) produce enhancer RNAs enriched with functional eRNA regulatory motifs (FERMs), and (3) drive expression of cell proliferation genes with promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II. Importantly, low dose ERα enhancer usage is elevated in breast cancer patients with poor responses to aromatase inhibitors, likely as a continued response to low circulating levels of E2. Collectively, our results identify mechanistic differences between low and high dose ERα enhancers that specify distinct biological outcomes.","Kim, Hyung Bum; Nandu, Tulip; Camacho, Cristel V; Kraus, W Lee","The Section of Laboratory Research, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390.; Program in Genetics, Development and Disease, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390, USA.; The Laboratory of Signaling and Gene Expression, Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, 75390.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,12,2025,09,14,R01 DK058110_DK_NIDDK NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832236,10.1101/2025.08.08.669412,40832236,0,,

40832272,Mutant IDH silences GSX2 to reprogram neural progenitor cell fate and promote gliomagenesis.,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase ( <i>IDH</i> ) mutations arise early in gliomas and are associated with a defined neurodevelopmental cancer cell hierarchy. However, how mutant IDH contributes to this hierarchy and whether this interaction promotes gliomagenesis remain unclear. We captured the dynamics of IDH-mutant glioma initiation in genetically engineered mice through time-resolved, single-cell genomics. Mutant IDH activates and induces lineage switching of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). These actions expand oligodendrocyte precursor cells, the predominant cell-of-origin for these tumors, at the expense of interneurons. Lineage switching is mediated by promoter hypermethylation and silencing of <i>Gsx2</i> , a homeobox gene required for neurogenesis. Critically, <i>Gsx2</i> ablation recapitulates NPC fate reprogramming by mutant IDH. We provide a new model of neural cell fate control by <i>IDH</i> oncogenes and insights into the developmental origins of glioma.","Xiao, Yi; Shi, Diana D; Guo, Lei; Neumann, Ethan; Levitt, Michael M; Kaphle, Pranita; Shipman, Tracey; Li, Haocheng; Cai, Feng; Ramirez, Denise M O; Zacharias, Lauren G; Chen, Zhenkang; Lin, Mathew; Puliyappadamba, Vinesh T; Chen, Tao; Savani, Milan R; Peña, Salvador; Wansapura, Janaka; Mathews, Thomas P; Mishra, Prashant; Kim, Yoon Jung; Raj, Prithvi; Richardson, Timothy E; Xu, Jian; Mack, Stephen C; Rahme, Gilbert J; Bernstein, Bradley E; DeBerardinis, Ralph J; Tirosh, Itay; Suvà, Mario L; Xu, Lin; Abdullah, Kalil G; McBrayer, Samuel K",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,13,2025,09,14,K22 CA237752_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R00 CA267082_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA289260_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 NS142141_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; K99 CA277576_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA258586_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; F30 CA271634_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832272,10.1101/2025.08.12.667486,40832272,0,,

While BLAST+ remains the standard for sequence similarity searches, population-level studies often require custom scripting and manual curation of results, which can present barriers for many researchers. We developed SeqForge, a scalable, modular command-line toolkit that streamlines alignment-based searches and motif mining across large genomic datasets. SeqForge automates BLAST+ database creation and querying, integrates amino acid motif discovery, enables sequence and contig extraction, and curates results into structured, easily parsed formats. The platform supports diverse input formats, parallelized execution for high-performance computing environments, and built-in visualization tools. Benchmarking demonstrates that SeqForge achieves near-linear runtime scaling for computationally intensive modules while maintaining modest memory usage. SeqForge lowers the computational barrier for large-scale meta/genomic exploration, enabling researchers to perform population-scale BLAST searches, motif detection, and sequence curation without custom scripting. The toolkit is freely available and platform-independent, making it suitable for both personal workstations and high-performance computing environments.","Horvath, Elijah R Bring; Winter, Jaclyn M","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84112, United States.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,15,2025,09,14,R01 AI155694_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832300,10.1101/2025.08.12.669971,40832300,0,,
40832221,Integrated histopathologic modeling of detailed tumor subtypes and actionable biomarkers.,"Accurate cancer subtyping with accompanying molecular characterization is critical for precision oncology. While machine learning approaches have been applied to both digital pathology and cancer genomics, previous work has been limited in sample size and has typically aggregated granular cancer subtypes into coarse groupings , likely obfuscating informative molecular and prognostic associations and phenotypic variation of more detailed tumor subtypes. Accordingly, we collated 378,123 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) with matched targeted DNA clinical sequencing results and OncoTree detailed cancer subtypes from a real-world cohort of 71,142 patients. Using this scaled, granular dataset and a cancer subtype knowledge graph, we developed Mosaic: a family of calibrated machine learning models using H&E WSI embeddings to classify tumors and identify molecular phenotypes across 163 detailed subtypes. The cancer subtyping module (Aeon) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.992 overall, with 161/163 subtypes reaching an AUROC ≥ 0.90 and improved performance over a state-of-the-art genomics-based classifier. The genomic inference module (Paladin) achieved an AUROC ≥ 0.80 for 167 pairs of detailed subtypes and genomic targets. We further used the learned histopathologic representations to i) identify key associations of the histopathologic embeddings with clinical biomarkers; ii) identify unsupervised sub-clusters of tumors with genomic determinants of tumor phenotype; iii) specify granular diagnoses for cancers of unknown primary, evaluated by genomic associations and expected clinical outcome distributions; iv) annotate functional significance for variants of uncertain significance (VUS); and v) identify cases that mimic the phenotypic effect of known DNA variants on H&E in the absence of detectable DNA alterations. Taken together, this work advances our understanding of phenotypic variation of granular tumor subtypes, their relevance to enhanced diagnostics, and their potential utility in risk stratification with multimodal machine learning in cancer.","Boehm, Kevin M; Darmofal, Madison; Pasha, Arfath; Aukerman, Andrew; Lim, Raymond; Seffar, Evan; Pollard, Tom; Rekhtman, Natasha; Chang, Jason; Kohli, Armaan; Moore, Darin; Ligero, Marta; Gao, JianJiong; Asimomitis, Georgios; Begum, Anika; Pareja, Fresia; Al-Ahmadie, Hikmat; Busam, Klaus J; Dimitriou, Nikolaos M; Hameed, Meera; Dogan, Ahmet; Ellenson, Lora H; Chen, Jie-Fu; Gomez, Daniel; Lee, Nancy; Sherman, Eric; Nagar, Himanshu; Braunstein, Lior Z; Weigelt, Britta; Fagin, James; Fu, Susan; Alarcon, Jonathan; Patil, Neelraj; Alsaafin, Areej; Brannon, A Rose; Amoah, Kofi; Eichholz, Jordan; Voss, Martin; Jee, Justin; Fong, Christopher; Waters, Michele; Pike, Luke R G; Razavi, Pedram; Romesser, Paul; Khan, Atif; Chatila, Walid K; Islam, Aasiya; Sverdlik, Elana; de Bruijn, Ino; Nasir, Zain-Ul-Abideen; Pichotta, Karl; Shia, Jinru; Antonescu, Cristina R; Reuter, Victor; Lee, Jake June-Koo; Ladanyi, Marc; Ardon, Orly; Elenitoba-Johnson, Kojo; Berger, Michael F; Solit, David; Schultz, Nikolaus; Shah, Sohrab P; Sanchez-Vega, Francisco",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,16,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832221,10.1101/2025.08.14.670351,40832221,0,,
40894550,Automated chromatin profiling with spa-ChIP seq uncovers the impacts of condition variations.,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a well-established method for studying the genomic localization of DNA-associated proteins. Yet, while useful, most ChIP-seq protocols include multiple manual steps that can introduce inconsistency and make it burdensome to analyze large sample sets, limiting the inclusion of appropriate replicates and other controls. Although some of these challenges were addressed by incorporation of liquid handling platforms, most of those previous efforts have automated only a subset of the ChIP-seq steps. Further, using automation for efficiently mapping non-histone proteins, such as chromatin regulators, has been challenging. We recently developed a single-pot ChIP-seq protocol<sup>1</sup>. Here we established a liquid handler operation for this protocol and created an end-to-end fully automated version that is scalable from 8 to 96 ChIP-seq reactions. Our single-pot automated (spa-ChIP-seq) protocol requires about 3 days from cross-linked cells to library, and the costs to produce indexed libraries is approximately $70 per sample. We first benchmarked spa-ChIP-seq against manual ChIP-seq that was performed in parallel, showing a nearly indistinguishable signal-to-noise ratio between the two workflows. Next, we used spa-ChIP-seq to systematically evaluate multiple parameters including shearing and crosslinking conditions, buffer compositions, and antibody to cell-number ratios. Our method allowed us to identify optimal conditions for double crosslinked chromatin as well as easily and robustly conduct titrations and screening of different antibodies and reagents, eliminating many laborious and costly steps. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the effect of the ratio of antibody to cell-number is most pronounced in detecting weak genomic localization signals. In particular, while strong signal seems to be unimpacted by low antibody to cell-number ratio, weaker signals are sensitive to this ratio.

40894803,A single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the pigtail macaque placenta in late gestation.,"The placenta is a complex organ with multiple immune and non-immune cell types that promote fetal tolerance and facilitate the transfer of nutrients and oxygen. The nonhuman primate (NHP) is a key experimental model for studying human pregnancy complications, in part due to similarities in placental structure, which makes it essential to understand how single-cell populations compare across the human and NHP maternal-fetal interface. We constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) atlas of the placenta from the pigtail macaque ( <i>Macaca nemestrina</i> ) in the third trimester, comprising three different tissues at the maternal-fetal interface: the chorionic villi (placental disc), chorioamniotic membranes, and the maternal decidua. Each tissue was separately dissociated into single cells and processed through the 10X Genomics and Seurat pipeline, followed by aggregation, unsupervised clustering, and cluster annotation. Next, we determined the maternal-fetal origins of cell populations and analyzed single-cell RNA trajectory, Gene Ontology enrichment, and cell-cell communication. Single-cell populations in the pigtail macaque were strikingly similar in their identity and frequency to those found in the human placenta, including cells from trophoblast, stromal cell, immune, and macrophage lineages. An advantage of our approach was the deep sequencing of three tissues at the maternal-fetal interface, which yielded a rich diversity of common and rare single-cell populations. The third-trimester pigtail macaque single-cell atlas enables the identification of cellular subclusters analogous to those in humans and provides a powerful resource for understanding experimental perturbations on the NHP placenta.","Li, Amanda; Li, Richard; Huang, Hazel; Zhao, Hong; Del Rosario, Briana; Li, Miranda; Li, Edmunda; Vo, Andrew; Manuel, Gygeria; Cervantes, Orlando; Kapur, Raj P; Munson, Jeff; Orvis, Austyn; Coleman, Michelle; Berg, Melissa; Curtis, Britni; Menz, Brenna; Dai, Jin; Golez, Inah; Wangari, Solomon; English, Chris; Baldessari, Audrey; Rajagopal, Lakshmi; Cornelius, John; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,20,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894803,10.1101/2025.08.15.669966,40894803,0,0,NONE

To address this need, we developed a reproducible and scalable Snakemake workflow called WeavePop, which aligns samples to selected references, obtains reference-based assemblies, annotations, and sequences, and identifies small variants and copy-number variants in eukaryotic haploid organisms. All the results are integrated into a database that can be easily shared and explored through a graphical web interface provided alongside the workflow, making the discovery of variants in a population of study very simple. WeavePop is available from GitHub (https://github.com/magwenelab/WeavePop) for Linux operating systems.

40894649,Semi-supervised detection of natural selection with positive-unlabeled learning.,"Identifying genomic regions shaped by natural selection is a central goal in evolutionary genomics. Existing machine learning methods for this task are typically trained using simulated genomic data labeled according to specific evolutionary scenarios. While effective in controlled settings, these models are limited by their reliance on explicit class labels. They can only detect the specific processes they were trained to recognize, making it difficult to interpret predictions for regions influenced by other evolutionary forces. This limitation is especially problematic when analyzing empirical genomes shaped by a mixture of adaptive, demographic, and ecological factors. One-vs.-rest strategies offer a potential alternative, but suffer from the inherent complexity of modeling all other evolutionary and demographic processes as a catch-all ""rest"" class. Here, we explore positive-unlabeled learning as a more flexible framework for detection of adaptive events. Positive-unlabeled learning is a semi-supervised approach that permits identification of samples of a target class using only positive labels and an unlabeled background, without requiring explicit modeling of negative samples. To assess the utility of this approach, we focus on a binary classification setting for detecting selective sweeps (positive samples) arising from positive natural selection against a mixed background composed of both unlabeled sweeps and neutrally-evolving regions. To accomplish this goal, we introduce <i>PULSe</i>, a method that employs only a set of labeled sweep observations for training while treating all remaining data as unlabeled. By avoiding assumptions about the composition of the background, <i>PULSe</i> enables robust sweep discovery in realistic genomic landscapes. We systematically evaluate its performance across a range of demographic, adaptive, and confounding contexts, including domain shift arising from misspecified demographic models, and find that <i>PULSe</i> delivers high performance and generalizability. To demonstrate a practical application of <i>PULSe</i>, we analyzed European and Bengali in Bangladesh human genomes, treating the empirical genomes as unlabeled sets, and recapitulating several previously-identified sweep candidates. Our results show that <i>PULSe</i> provides a powerful and versatile alternative for detecting adaptive regions, with the potential to generalize across a range of genomic landscapes.","Arnab, Sandipan Paul; Dos Santos, Andre Luiz Campelo; Fumagalli, Matteo; DeGiorgio, Michael","The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK.; School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,18,2025,09,15,R35 GM128590_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894649,10.1101/2025.08.15.670602,40894649,0,0,NONE

40832322,Multimodal learning decodes the global binding landscape of chromatin-associated proteins.,"Chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs), including over 1,600 transcription factors, bind directly or indirectly to the genomic DNA to regulate gene expression and determine a myriad of cell types. Mapping their genome-wide binding and co-binding landscape is essential towards a mechanistic understanding of their functions in gene regulation and resulting cellular phenotypes. However, due to the lack of techniques that effectively scale across proteins and biological samples, their genome-wide binding profiles remain challenging to obtain, particularly in primary cells. Here we present Chromnitron, a multimodal foundation model that accurately predicts CAP binding landscapes across hundreds of proteins in unseen cell types. Via <i>in silico</i> perturbation experiments, we show that the model learned principles of CAP binding from multimodal features including DNA sequence motifs, chromatin accessibility levels, and protein functional domains. Applying Chromnitron to study cell fate transitions, we discovered novel CAPs regulating the T cell exhaustion process. Furthermore, Chromnitron can predict the dynamic CAP binding landscapes during development, revealing the global orchestration of protein and regulatory element activities in neurogenesis. We expect Chromnitron to accelerate discovery and engineering in regulatory genomics, particularly in human primary cells, and empower future therapeutic opportunities.","Tan, Jimin; Fu, Xi; Ling, Xinyu; Mo, Shentong; Bai, Jiangshan; Rabadán, Raúl; Fenyö, David; Boeke, Jef D; Tsirigos, Aristotelis; Xia, Bo","Division of Precision Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Gene Regulation Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Systems Genetics, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Pathology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Society of Fellows, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program of Mathematical Genomics, Department of System Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,17,2025,09,11,DP5 OD033430_OD_NIH HHS_United States; P01 CA229086_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R03 OD036495_OD_NIH HHS_United States; R35 CA253126_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; P30 CA013696_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA252239_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40832322,10.1101/2025.08.17.670761,40832322,0,,

We conducted a six-week longitudinal study in a Swiss secondary school (67 students, aged 14-15). We detected 87 infections in saliva samples and recorded absences to identify plausible transmissions, excluding implausible ones through genomic analysis. Time in close proximity (within 1.5 metres) was measured using wearable sensors and air quality via CO<sub>2</sub> monitors. Students spent 21.2 minutes per day in close proximity (interquartile range 7.8-44.2) and 5.3 hours in shared classrooms (IQR 3.8-6.2), during which air quality was suboptimal for 1.9 hours (IQR 1.2-3.0). Using pairwise survival models, we found that transmission was more likely within than between classes. Close proximity was modestly associated with higher transmission risk overall (rate ratio 1.16 per doubling daily time, 95%-CI 1.01-1.33), while time in shared classrooms (RR 8.96, 95%-CI 4.85-16.88) and suboptimal air quality (RR 5.59 95%-CI 3.25-9.83) also predicted within-class risk.

Yet existing methods lack flexibility and controllability to adapt to various design objectives. We propose a novel framework, ARCADE, that enables flexible control over generated codon sequences. ARCADE is based on activation engineering and leverages inherent knowledge from pretrained genomic foundation models. Our approach extends activation engineering techniques beyond discrete feature manipulation to continuous biological metrics. Specifically, we define biologically meaningful semantic steering vectors in the model's activation space, which directly modulate continuous-valued properties such as the codon adaptation index, minimum free energy, and GC content without retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and far greater flexibility of ARCADE compared to existing codon optimization approaches, underscoring its potential for advancing programmable biological sequence design.","Li, Jiayi; Liang, Litian; Du, Shiyi; Tang, Shijie; Lai, Hong-Sheng; Kingsford, Carl","Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15217, US.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,23,2025,09,15,R01 HG012470_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894773,10.1101/2025.08.19.668819,40894773,0,0,NONE

Here, we assess the bioinformatics capabilities of three popular general-purpose LLMs on a set of tasks covering basic analytical questions that include code writing and multi-step reasoning in the domain. Utilizing questions from Rosalind, a bioinformatics educational platform, we compare the performance of the LLMs vs. humans on 104 questions undertaken by 110 to 68,760 individuals globally. GPT-3.5 provided correct answers for 59/104 (58%) questions, while Llama-3-70B and GPT-4o answered 49/104 (47%) correctly. GPT-3.5 was the best performing in most categories, followed by Llama-3-70B and then GPT-4o. 71% of the questions were correctly answered by at least one LLM. The best performing categories included DNA analysis, while the worst performing were sequence alignment/comparative genomics and genome assembly. Overall, LLMs performance mirrored that of humans with lower performance in tasks in which humans had low performance and vice versa. However, LLMs also failed in some instances where most humans were correct and, in a few cases, LLMs excelled where most humans failed.

The hypervirulent serotype III, sequence type 17 (ST-17) strain COH1 is strongly associated with late-onset disease due to its unique set of virulence factors. However, genetic manipulation of ST-17 strains is notoriously challenging, limiting the ability to study key pathogenic genes. In this study, we developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system utilizing an endogenous catalytically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) in the COH1 strain, enabling targeted and tunable gene expression knockdown. We confirmed the efficacy of this system through hemolysis assays, qPCR transcriptional analysis, and in vitro infection models using human brain endothelial cells. The CRISPRi system successfully produced phenotypic knockdowns of essential virulence genes, including <i>pilA, srr2</i> , and <i>iagA</i> , reducing adhesion, invasion, and inflammatory responses at the blood-brain barrier. This platform enables rapid gene knockdowns for functional genomics in ST-17 GBS, enabling high-throughput screening and pathogenesis research. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the world's leading cause of neonatal meningitis. GBS-host interactions at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are dependent on bacterial factors, including surface factors and two-component systems. Multi-locus sequence type 17 (ST-17) GBS strains are highly associated with neonatal meningitis, and these strains harbor many virulence factors for infection at the BBB. Historically, these factors have been studied using traditional knockout mutagenesis, which has proven challenging in the most common ST-17 lab strain, COH1. This study utilizes CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to generate rapid expression knockdown.

40909691,<i>Plasmodium</i> ARK1 regulates spindle formation during atypical mitosis and forms a divergent chromosomal passenger complex.,"Mitosis in <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria, is fundamentally different from model eukaryotes, proceeding via a bipartite microtubule organising centre (MTOC) and lacking canonical regulators such as Polo and Bub1 kinases. During schizogony, asynchronous nuclear replication produces a multinucleate schizont, while rapid male gametogony generates an octaploid nucleus before gamete formation. Here, we identify Aurora-related kinase 1 (ARK1) as a key component of inner MTOC and spindle formation, controlling kinetochore dynamics and driving mitotic progression. Conditional ARK1 depletion disrupts spindle biogenesis, kinetochore segregation, karyokinesis and cytokinesis in both stages, and affects parasite transmission. Interactome analysis reveals ARK1 as the catalytic core of a non-canonical chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) containing two divergent inner centromere proteins (INCENPs) but lacking Survivin and Borealin. Comparative genomics indicates this CPC architecture arose early in Apicomplexa, replacing canonical centromere-targeting modules. These findings uncover a distinct mitotic machinery in <i>Plasmodium</i> and identify the ARK1-INCENP interface as a potential multistage target for malaria therapeutic intervention.","Nagar, Annu; Yanase, Ryuji; Zeeshan, Mohammad; Ferguson, David J P; Abel, Steven; Pashley, Sarah L; Mishra, Akancha; Eze, Antonius; Rea, Edward; Brady, Declan; Bottrill, Andrew R; Vaughan, Sue; Le Roch, Karine G; Guttery, David S; Holder, Anthony A; Tromer, Eelco C; Sharma, Pushkar; Tewari, Rita",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,bioRxiv,,2025,08,27,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40909691,10.1101/2025.08.27.672654,40909691,0,0,NONE
40841172,High-quality assembly of the Chinese white truffle genome and recalibrated divergence time estimate provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of Tuberaceae.,"The genus <i>Tuber</i> (family: Tuberaceae) includes the most economically valuable ectomycorrhizal (ECM), truffle-forming fungi. Previous genomic analyses revealed that massive transposable element (TE) proliferation represents a convergent genomic feature of ECM fungi, including Tuberaceae. Repetitive sequences constitute a principal driver of genome evolution shaping its architecture and regulatory networks. In this context, Tuberaceae can become an important model system to study their genomic impact; however, the family lacks high-quality assemblies. Here, we investigate the interplay between TEs and Tuberaceae genome evolution by producing a highly contiguous assembly for the endangered Chinese white truffle <i>Tuber panzhihuanense</i>, along with a recalibrated timeline for Tuberaceae diversification and comprehensive comparative genomic analyses. We find that, concurrently with a Paleogene diversification of the family, pre-existing Chromoviridae-related Gypsy clades independently expanded in different truffle lineages, leading to increased genome size and high gene family turnover rates, but without resulting in highly rearranged genomes. Additionally, we uncover a significant enrichment of ECM-induced gene families stemming from ancestral duplication events. Finally, we explore the repetitive structure of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci for the first time in the clade. Most of the 45S rDNA paralogues are undergoing concerted evolution, though an isolated divergent locus raises concerns about potential issues for metabarcoding and biodiversity assessments. Our study establishes a fundamental genomic resource for future research on truffle genomics and showcases a clear example of how establishment and self-perpetuating expansion of heterochromatin can drive massive genome size variation due to activity of selfish genetic elements.","Martelossi, Jacopo; Vujovic, Jacopo; Huang, Yue; Tatti, Alessia; Xu, Kaiwei; Puliga, Federico; Chen, Yuanxue; Rota Stabelli, Omar; Ghiselli, Fabrizio; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zambonelli, Alessandra","Sichuan Agricultural University.; University of Bologna.; University of Bologna, University of Trento; jacopo.martelossi@senckenberg.de.; University of Bologna, Sichuan Agricultural University.; University of Trento, Fondazione Edmund Mach.; University of Trento, University School for Advanced Studies IUSS Pavia.",Genome research,Genome Res,,2025,08,21,2025,08,21,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40841172,10.1101/gr.280368.124,40841172,0,0,NONE
40841174,Pangenome-based genome inference using integer programming.,"Affordable genotyping methods are essential in genomics. Commonly used genotyping methods primarily support single nucleotide variants and short indels but neglect structural variants. Additionally, accuracy of read alignments to a reference genome is unreliable in highly polymorphic and repetitive regions, further impacting genotyping performance. Recent works highlight the advantage of haplotype-resolved pangenome graphs in addressing these challenges. Building on these developments, we propose a rigorous alignment-free genotyping method. Our optimization framework identifies a path through the pangenome graph that maximizes the matches between the path and substrings of sequencing reads (e.g., <i>k</i>-mers) while minimizing recombination events (haplotype switches) along the path. We prove that this problem is NP-Hard and develop efficient integer-programming solutions. We benchmarked the algorithm using downsampled short-read datasets from homozygous human cell lines with coverage ranging from 0.1× to 10×. Our algorithm accurately estimates complete major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype sequences with small edit distances from the ground-truth sequences, providing a significant advantage over existing methods on low-coverage inputs. While this algorithm is designed for haploid genomes, we discuss directions for extending it to diploid genotyping.","Chandra, Ghanshyam; Hossen, Md Helal; Scholz, Stephan; Dilthey, Alexander T; Gibney, Daniel; Jain, Chirag",The University of Texas at Dallas.; Indian Institute of Science.; Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf.; Indian Institute of Science; chirag@iisc.ac.in.,Genome research,Genome Res,,2025,08,21,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40841174,10.1101/gr.280567.125,40841174,0,0,NONE
40811332,Efficient and Scalable Alignment-Free Distributed Genotyping of SNPs and Short Indels.,"The growing volume of sequencing data and the ever-larger size of variants databases challenge genotyping procedures to handle massive genomics datasets efficiently. Recent alignment-free solutions leverage exclusively on the k-mers counts to speed up the analysis, but have to trade off the time gain against the memory requirements, to make the elaborations possible on a single workstation. In this paper, we present SparkGeno+, a novel alignment-free (AF) distributed pipeline for the fast and accurate genotyping of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels on a large scale. Starting from a previous pipeline, we identified and evaluated the performance bottlenecks that arise when performing genotyping using a standard AF approach, to develop and implement several innovations to better exploit the resources of a distributed system. The effectiveness of our proposal has been validated through an experimental analysis on widely studied datasets. The results show that the accuracy of SparkGeno+ matches the one of state-of-the-art alignment-free tools like Vargeno and MALVA. Moreover, the time performance of SparkGeno+ scales well with the number of computing units, thus allowing execution times that are in order of growth smaller than those of classical genotyping tools. This indicates SparkGeno+ to be a promising solution for large-scale genotyping applications.","Rocco, Lorenzo Di; Petrillo, Umberto Ferraro",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,08,13,2025,08,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40811332,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3525547,40811332,0,,
40811311,Multiomics Data Integration of Lipid Metabolism in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Studies Using Bioinformatics Networks Based on Vertical and Horizontal Comparisons.,"Exploring changes in lipid metabolism is helpful for providing unique insight into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis mechanisms and early hepatocarcinogenesis. However, lipid metabolism involves different omics molecular interactions by means of both linear and nonlinear forms. Thus, we proposed a novel network construction method based on molecular pair evaluation from linear and nonlinear viewpoints (PELN) for clinical studies. In PELN, molecular relationships were explored in depth by horizontal comparison (linear relationship) and vertical comparison (nonlinear relationship) to reflect disease development for biomarker discovery. In the score calculated by PELN, case ratios and case frequencies were used to comprehensively measure the discriminative ability of the molecular pairs, which can reduce the influence of sampling variability resulting from different subjects. HCC genomics and metabolomics datasets related to lipid metabolism were analyzed by PELN, and the selected network warning signals were shown to effectively predict cancer onset. The experimental results showed that compared with other network methods, including DMNC, DNB-HC, ATSD-DN and MN-PCC, PELN was more robust and precise for distinguishing HCC samples from non-HCC samples. Further analysis using statistical methods demonstrated that studying changes in lipid metabolism using PELN based on multiomics data can help to further understand the pathological mechanisms associated with HCC development, contributing to early diagnosis and affecting clinical prognosis.","Huang, Xin; Li, Mengjun; Zhou, Yang; He, Xinyu",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,08,13,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40811311,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3558760,40811311,0,,
40811250,Perfect Phylogenies via the Minimum Uncovering Branching Problem: Efficiently Solvable Cases.,"In this paper, we present new efficiently solvable cases of the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem, an optimization problem with applications in cancer genomics introduced by Hujdurović, Husić, Milanič, Rizzi, and Tomescu in 2018. The problem involves a family of finite sets, and the goal is to map each non-maximal set to exactly one set that contains it, minimizing the sum of uncovered elements across all sets in the family. Hujdurović et al. formulated the problem in terms of branchings of the digraph formed by the proper set inclusion relation on the input sets and studied the problem complexity based on properties of the corresponding partially ordered set, in particular, with respect to its height and width, defined respectively as the maximum cardinality of a chain and an antichain. They showed that the problem is APX-complete for instances of bounded height and that a constant-factor approximation algorithm exists for instances of bounded width, but left the exact complexity for bounded-width instances open. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We derive this result by examining the structural properties of optimal solutions and reducing the problem to computing maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and maximum weight antichains in partially ordered sets. We also introduce a new polynomially computable lower bound and identify another condition for polynomial-time solvability.","Baghirova, Narmina; Milanic, Martin; Galby, Esther",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,06,16,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40811250,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3580476,40811250,0,,
40811257,Closing the Complexity Gap of the Double Distance Problem.,"Genome rearrangement has been an active area of research in computational comparative genomics for the last three decades. While initially mostly an interesting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application of rearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming common practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes. Several genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes with surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that computing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in linear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one has to always be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity analysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double distance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and a duplicated genome that - in addition to rearrangements - are separated by a whole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the duplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right after the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example of a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double distance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear time, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there is a whole family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between the breakpoint distance (k = 2) at the one end and the DCJ distance (k = ∞) at the other end. Only little was known about the hardness border that lies somewhere on the way between these two extremes. Precisely, beneath the two border cases the (linear) problem complexity was known only for k = 4 and k = 6. In this paper we close the gap, giving a full picture of the hardness landscape when computing the double distance.","Cunha, Luis; Lopes, Thiago; Souza, Ueverton; Bohnenkamper, Leonard; Braga, Marilia D V; Stoye, Jens",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,07,18,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40811257,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3590588,40811257,0,,
40811169,A Novel Kernel-Based Hilbert Space Framework for Predictive Modeling of lncRNA-miRNA-Disease Interaction Networks.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital regulators of gene expression. They are closely linked to the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Their interactions form complex lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks (LMDNets), which modulate key disease-associated biological pathways. Although recent computational approaches have attempted to integrate diverse biological data such as gene expression profiles, sequence information, and disease associations. They often face significant challenges, including limited interpretability, reliance on manually curated datasets, poor scalability, and high sensitivity to noise and missing data. To overcome these limitations, we propose KHSF-LMDNet, a kernel-based Hilbert space framework for modeling lncRNA-miRNA-disease networks. This model integrates graph-based biological networks, similarity features, and deep learning with an attention mechanism to map complex interactions into a Hilbert subspace, enabling more robust and interpretable learning. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, KHSF-LMDNet consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Additionally, it effectively ranks disease-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs, identifying top candidates related to cancer and Alzheimer's disease, thereby supporting functional genomics research and facilitating the discovery of novel biomarkers for precision medicine.","Saxena, Shivani; Rizvi, Ahsan Z",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,08,12,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40811169,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3598013,40811169,0,,
40857189,Towards an Embedded SoC for Mobile DNA Sequencing Applications.,"The development of small DNA sequencers offers a transformative opportunity for portable genomics. However, current systems lack integrated bioinformatics computing and instead rely on bulky external systems. To address this limitation, we propose an embedded System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture aimed at mobile DNA sequencing applications, representing an initial step towards a fully integrated bioinformatics solution. The proposed heterogeneous SoC leverages the open-source RISCV architecture and incorporates two specialized bioinformatics accelerators: one for deep learning-based basecalling and the other for sequence alignment. An FPGA-realized basecalling accelerator achieves a nearly 2000× speedup over a standalone RISC-V core and demonstrates 11.5× and 1.2× higher energy efficiency than x86 CPUs and high-end GPUs, respectively, while maintaining an accuracy rate of 83.7%. A separate accelerator optimized for sequence comparison, offers 538× and 357× performance-per-joule boost relative to x86 CPUs and an existing state-of-the-art accelerator, respectively, while far exceeding other platforms. A preliminary ASIC prototype operates at 250 MHz with a power consumption of 34 mW, demonstrating significant potential for the proposed approach. Overall, the proposed SoC architecture presents a compelling first step towards embedded bioinformatics hardware for mobile DNA sequencing.","Wu, Zhongpan; Beyene, Abel; Hammad, Karim; Ghafar-Zadeh, Ebrahim; Magierowski, Sebastian",,IEEE transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,IEEE Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,,2025,08,26,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40857189,10.1109/TCBBIO.2025.3602886,40857189,0,0,NONE
40844938,Uncertainty-Aware Survival Analysis with Dirichlet Distribution for Multi-Scale Pathology and Genomics.,"Over the last few decades, the integration of AI-driven computational techniques into digital pathology has revolutionized survival prediction tasks. However, most existing methods in survival analysis discretize the entire survival period into predefined intervals, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in event occurrence and the heterogeneity of patient survival times. The censored data further exacerbate these challenges, amplifying uncertainty and variability. To address these limitations, we introduce the Dirichlet distribution to model discretized outputs as continuous probability distributions, providing a more accurate representation of uncertainty awareness. Building upon this foundation, we propose a universal multi-modal survival analysis loss function that leverages uncertainty-driven fusion. Our Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Modal Survival Analysis (UMSA) framework further explores the interactions between multi-scale pathological images and genomic data, providing promising insights into multi-modal survival analysis. Experimental evaluations on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that UMSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and scalability in survival prediction tasks.","Jiang, Songhan; Cai, Linghan; Gan, Zhengyu; Wang, Yifeng; Tang, Guo; Zhang, Yongbing",,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,2025,08,22,2025,08,22,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40844938,10.1109/TMI.2025.3601892,40844938,0,0,NONE

Evidence suggests that most transcription factors binding sites are part of a CRM, so our new approach is expected to yield stronger candidates for <i>de novo</i> inference of candidate regulatory elements and their combinatorial regulation of genes. Thanks to our genetic algorithms based approach, we are able to search relatively large input sequences (100,000nt or longer). Most current computational approaches to identifying candidate CRMs depend on foreknowledge of the processes that the genes they regulate are involved in. In comparison with one leading method, Cluster-Buster, our prototype <i>de novo</i> approach, which we call GAMI-CRM, performed well, suggesting that GAMI-CRM will be particularly useful in predicting CRMs for genes whose interactions are poorly understood.","Thompson, Jeffrey A; Congdon, Clare Bates","Department of Computer Science University of Southern Maine Portland, Maine 04104.",Proceedings of the ...

Imputation is usually applied to large and well-characterised datasets of humans and livestock, even though it could also benefit smaller natural populations. This study aims to understand the best practices and effectiveness of imputation with a small reference panel for species with low genetic diversity, using a case study of a population of the hihi/stitchbird (Notiomystis cincta). We used a leave-one-out method to test imputation on 30 high-coverage hihi individuals where SNPs were masked before being imputed with Beagle v5.4. Imputation accuracy was measured using r<sup>2</sup>, the correlation between imputed and ground truth genotype dosages. We tested combinations of five imputation parameters, the inclusion of two linkage maps, reference panels of different sizes and compositions and targets of various SNP densities and sporadic missingness. We achieved mean r<sup>2</sup> exceeding 0.95 in most tests from a small reference panel of high-fecundity individuals. Imputation accuracy was not improved by including a linkage map and decreased at very low SNP densities. Imputed SNPs were filtered using r<sup>2</sup> to assess downstream heterozygosity calculations, the site frequency spectrum (SFS) and inference of runs of homozygosity (ROHs). We found that filtering and SNP density greatly affected heterozygosity and SFS at low SNP densities but that ROH inference was relatively robust to both. We provide a template for testing and optimising imputation in other wild populations.","Tan, Hui Zhen; Stuart, Katarina C; Vi, Tram; Whibley, Annabel; Bailey, Sarah; Brekke, Patricia; Santure, Anna W","Bragato Research Institute, Lincoln, New Zealand.; Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, London, UK.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.; Centre for Computational Evolution (CCE), Faculty of Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.",Molecular ecology resources,Mol Ecol Resour,,2025,08,12,2025,08,13,"NONE_NONE_Genomics Aotearoa_; NONE_NONE_George Mason Centre for the Natural Environment, University of Auckland_; NONE_NONE_Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment_; NONE_NONE_Research England_; NONE_NONE_University of Auckland_; NONE_NONE_Little Barrier Island (Hauturu) Supporters Trust_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40797301,10.1111/1755-0998.70024,40797301,0,,
40905325,Quaternary Habitat Fluctuations and Demographic Dynamics in Turtles Inferred From Environmental Niche Modelling and Whole Genome Data.,"Quaternary climatic fluctuations had a substantial influence on ecosystems, species distribution, phenology and genetic diversity, driving extinction, adaptation and demographic shifts during glacial periods and postglacial expansions. Integration of genomic data and environmental niche modelling can provide valuable insights on how organisms responded to past environmental variations and contribute to assessing vulnerability and resilience to ongoing climatic challenges. Among vertebrates, turtles are particularly vulnerable to habitat changes because of distinctive life history traits and the effect of environmental conditions on physiology and survival. We estimated contemporary heterozygosity (H) and effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) using a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome we produced for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) and reference genomes and whole genome sequence data available for 21 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles. We implemented environmental niche modelling (ENM) to estimate past habitat dynamics. We found recurrent cycles of population expansion and contraction over the last 10 Mya in all species, with a general pattern of decrease in N<sub>e</sub> correlated with temperature reduction after the last interglacial period. No correlation was found between habitat fluctuations during the Quaternary and past N<sub>e</sub>. Moreover, neither H nor mean N<sub>e</sub> was correlated to threat status as defined by IUCN Red List categories. Our results add to studies on other vertebrates showing the extent to which genetic parameters can aid the assessment of conservation status, and although genomic data may not always be consistent indicators of the level of threat, investigations of which genomic parameters could best represent essential biodiversity variables should be consistently supported.","Sozzoni, Marcella; Balacco, Jennifer; Bellavita, Massimo; Brüniche-Olsen, Anna; Formenti, Giulio; Jain, Nivesh; Koo, Bonhwang; Mountcastle, Jacquelyn; Palmada-Flores, Marc; Trifonov, Vladimir; Chelazzi, Guido; Fratini, Sara; Jarvis, Erich D; Natali, Chiara; Nespoli, Davide; Ciofi, Claudio; Iannucci, Alessio","Department of Biology, University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland, USA.; Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia.; Vertebrate Genome Laboratory, The Rockefeller University, New York City, New York, USA.; Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Riserva Naturale Regionale Monte Rufeno, Acquapendente, Italy.; Tree of Life, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK.; Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language, The Rockefeller University, New York City, New York, USA.",Molecular ecology resources,Mol Ecol Resour,,2025,09,04,2025,09,04,101059492_NONE_Biodiversity Genomics Europe_; NONE_NONE_Italian Ministry of University and Research Through the National Biodiversity Future Center (NBFC)_; 101074714_NONE_LIFE21-NAT-IT-LIFE-URCA-PROEMYS_; NONE_NONE_UK Research and Innovation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905325,10.1111/1755-0998.70040,40905325,0,0,NONE

If associations with microbial communities facilitate host adaptation to different ecosystems, understanding the important ecological factors that act as drivers of differences among conspecific populations' microbiomes can help conservation efforts to promote beneficial interactions between fish and their microbiome for freshwater fish species facing rapid environmental changes. Here we describe the microbial communities in the gut of a freshwater fish, Heterandria formosa, in spring habitats using 16S rRNA sequencing. We quantified microbiota composition and diversity among springs ranging from oligotrophic to near eutrophic to determine the extent to which the microbiota are associated with different environmental conditions. We found higher microbial richness at sites with lower nutrient load stress. At more eutrophic sites, we detected the potential for increased metabolic capacity for pollutant degradation in the associated microbiota. We noted greater phylogenetic similarity between more environmentally similar sites, supporting previous evidence that the microbiota of freshwater fish is influenced by site water chemistry.

A comprehensive genomic analysis was performed to elucidate the genetic basis underlying its probiotic potential. Fifteen genomic islands and CRISPR-Cas elements were identified in its genome. Pan-genomic analysis highlighted the dynamic evolution of this species, and clustering based on the nucleotide genomic similarity only partially correlated with the source of isolation or the geographic origin of the strains. Several genes known to confer probiotic properties were identified, including those related to adhesion, resistance to acidic pH and bile salts, tolerance to oxidative stress, metabolism/transport of sugars and other compounds, and genes for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. In silico analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence determinants confirmed the safety of this strain. Moreover, genes related to B-group vitamins biosynthesis and feruloyl esterase hydrolase were also found, showing the nutritional contribution of the strain, which also showed moderate adhesion capability, exopolysaccharide production when grown with sucrose, and the capacity to metabolise 42 out of 95 carbon substrates tested.

However, the application and integration of liquid biopsy testing into clinical practice has not been fully defined in Japan. Clinical records were retrieved from the data repository of the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) in Japan. All records related to FoundationOne Liquid tests were evaluated from the database's inception in June 2019 to June 2023. Outcomes of interest included treatment patterns before and after testing, as well as mutations of interest.

Of 7461 patient records, the most prevalent cancers were pancreatic (24.5%), prostate (15.8%), and biliary tract (11.2%) cancers. Following molecular tumor board (MTB) review, 5.8% of cases received new treatments, predominantly targeted therapy (41.7%) and chemotherapy (40.9%), with 2.1% participating in clinical trials.

40899323,"Integrative Transcriptomic Analysis Decodes the Interplay Between Aging, Senescence, and Cancer.","Cancer risk increases with age, and cellular senescence may be a major contributor to cellular carcinogenesis. Enormous efforts have been made to investigate the interrelation between aging and tumors, but little is known about the comparative features of normal aging, cellular senescence, and cancer at single-cell resolution. By integrating analyses of genomics, epigenomics, and bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, we revealed a directionally opposite transcriptional profile between cellular senescence and tumorigenesis at the single-cell level, which may be affected by epigenomic regulations. A total of 648 aging-dependent senescence-associated coregulated modules (SACMs), disproportionately affecting the reproductive systems of both females and males, were initially defined across 17 tissues. Single-cell analysis revealed that aging primarily affects endothelial cells, followed by T cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Opposite directions of change in gene expression between aging and cancer can commonly be observed in endothelial, fibroblast, and epithelial cells, which may prompt the opposing patterns of gene expression between tissue aging and epithelial carcinoma at the bulk level. A similar pattern of expression can be observed in immune cells, which are characterized by decreased self-renewal with aging, but this pattern is reversed in epithelial carcinoma. Our study highlighted the role of senescence as a natural barrier against tumor formation and supported the idea that aging-related systemic environment changes create a protumorigenic milieu.","Cai, Jiale; Wu, Deng; Xu, Dahua; Liu, Fujin; Li, Peihu; Zheng, Dehua; Xu, Zhizhou; Cao, Meng; Shen, Yutong; Zhang, Nihui; Tian, Guanghui; Fan, Chengyi; Wang, Bo; Li, Kongning; Bi, Xiaoman","College of Biomedical Information and Engineering, Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China.",Cancer science,Cancer Sci,,2025,09,03,2025,09,03,823RC581_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; 824QN271_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; 825QN315_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; HYYB2023A06_NONE_Innovative Research Project for Graduate Students in Hainan Medical University_; 32160152_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 32400543_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 822QN462_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; QCQTXM202212_NONE_Program of Hainan Association for Science and Technology Plans to Youth R & D Innovation_; ZDKJ2021040_NONE_Major Science and Technology Program of Hainan Province_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40899323,10.1111/cas.70178,40899323,0,0,NONE
40836506,Genomics and epilepsy: Opportunities to improve understanding and management.,"Genomics has advanced our understanding of epilepsy through the discovery of the causes of many hundreds of different individual syndromes and the discovery of common variants contributing to the epilepsy risk. Many genomic research studies and clinical genetic laboratories now use advanced sequencing methods, including whole-genome sequencing studies. Such work generates significant amounts of data beyond a possible causal variant alone and can contain information about more complicated genomic contributions to the phenotype, including oligogenic and polygenic influences, modifiers, risk factors for traits such as postictal psychosis, and pharmacogenomic variants of importance to adverse reactions. Extraction of such data will help improve the characterization of each individual's epilepsy, potentially from diagnosis onwards. Newer methods, such as single-cell studies and combinations of genomic data with other data types are now being used. Genomics may also help protect people with epilepsy from climate change challenges. Opportunities from genomics will continue to enhance our understanding and management of epilepsy.","Sisodiya, Sanjay M","Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, UK.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK.",Developmental medicine and child neurology,Dev Med Child Neurol,,2025,08,20,2025,08,21,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836506,10.1111/dmcn.16472,40836506,0,0,NONE
40786147,A Genome-Wide Analysis of Structure and Evolution in Irish and British Populations of <i>Bombus terrestris</i> (L. 1758): Implications for Genetic Resource Conservation.,"Insect pollinators play vital regulatory roles within ecosystems and provide humanity with essential services that support our health, wellbeing, and economies. Despite their importance, reported declines at regional and national levels have raised concerns over the continuation of such benefits. Island pollinator populations are of particular conservation interest as they may harbor lower genetic diversity due to restricted gene flow caused by geographical barriers, which may in turn influence local selective processes. In this study, we investigated the population structure and potential targets of selection within the genomes of a bumblebee subspecies, <i>Bombus terrestris audax,</i> native to the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. In particular, we compared the genomes of wild-caught populations from each island alongside representatives of other European subspecies and commercial imports to ascertain patterns of historical admixture. Our analysis identified a largely genetically distinct population of <i>B. t</i>. <i>audax</i> on the island of Ireland, with weak evidence of admixture. In addition, we find differential signatures of positive selection between the two island populations in genes associated with neurology and development, indicating potential local adaptation. Furthermore, we identified an extremely polymorphic region on chromosome 10 with evidence of shared haplotypes in both wild and commercial bees, which may represent long-standing genetic variation at the continental level or potential localized admixture between wild and commercial bees. Collectively, our findings inform on the genetic distinctiveness of these island bumblebees, emphasizing the applied need to genetically characterize natural populations to ensure the conservation of genetic resources-in the context of this study, by informing risk-assessment and management of commercial bumblebees. In addition, our study reinforces the utility of genomic approaches in the biomonitoring of isolated or regionally adapted insect pollinator populations, which will contribute towards the effective conservation of these ecologically vital organisms.","Larragy, Sarah J; Colgan, Thomas J; Stolle, Eckart; Mayack, Christopher; Köhler, Ina; Stout, Jane C; Carolan, James C","Department of Biology Maynooth University Maynooth County Kildare Ireland.; Insect Comparative Genomics Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK) Bonn Germany.; USDA/ARS/WRRC Invasive Species and Pollinator Health Research Unit Davis California USA.; Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Bioengineering Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabancı University Istanbul Türkiye.; Botany, School of Natural Sciences Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin Dublin Ireland.; Institute for Organismic and Molecular Evolutionary Biology Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz Mainz Germany.",Evolutionary applications,Evol Appl,,2025,08,08,2025,08,13,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40786147,10.1111/eva.70141,40786147,0,,
40917341,Population Genomics Reveals Panmixia in Pacific Sardine (<i>Sardinops sagax</i>) of the North Pacific.,"The spatial structure and dynamics of populations are important considerations when defining management units in organisms that are harvested as natural resources. In the Eastern Pacific, Pacific Sardine range from Chile to Alaska, the northernmost state of the United States (U.S.), and once supported an expansive and productive fishery. Along its North American range, it is hypothesized to comprise three subpopulations: a northern and southern subpopulation, which primarily occur off the coast of the U.S. and Baja California, Mexico (M.X.), respectively, and a third in the Gulf of California, M.X. We used low coverage whole genome sequencing to generate genotype likelihoods for millions of SNPs in 317 individuals collected from the Gulf of California, M.X., to Oregon, U.S., to assess population structure in Pacific Sardine. Differentiation across the genome was driven by variation at several putative chromosomal inversions ranging in size from ~21 MB to 0.89 MB, although none of the putative inversions showed any evidence of geographic differentiation. Our results support panmixia across an impressive ~4000 km range.","Longo, Gary C; D Amelio, Katie; Larson, Wes; Enciso, Concepción Enciso; Torre, Jorge; Minich, Jeremiah J; Michael, Todd P; Craig, Matthew T","The Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Laboratory The Salk Institute for Biological Studies California USA.; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science Center La Jolla California USA.; Centro Regional de Investigación Acuícola y Pesquera de Ensenada Instituto Mexicano de Investigación en Pesca y Acuacultura Sustentables, Carretera Tijuana-Ensenada Km 97.5 Parque Industrial Fondeport Ensenada México.; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories Juneau Alaska USA.; Comunidad y Biodiversidad, A.C Isla del Peruano 215, col.

This proof-of-concept study establishes patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs) as an advanced preclinical model to investigate and address metastatic HNSC. Indeed, PDOXs demonstrate noteworthy histopathological and molecular fidelity to primary HNSC tumours. Contrary to the traditional subcutaneous xenografts, PDOXs authentically replicate local lymph node metastasis, mirroring the intricate site-specific cancer-stroma interaction and the disease progression in patients. Furthermore, genomic and transcriptomic analyses underscore the genetic accuracy and heightened resemblance of PDOXs to patient tumours. Notably, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)-signalling-induced inflammation emerges as a key driver of the metastatic process, unveiling an inflammatory signature with potential implications as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target. These findings underscore the pivotal role of the PDOX model in capturing the complex biology of HNSC, providing insights for precision-targeted therapies and enhancing patient outcomes.","Bai, Yuchen; Blyth, Benjamin; Boath, Jarryd; Deng, Qiji; Huang, Ruihong; Darido, Charbel","The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.; Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.",The FEBS journal,FEBS J,,2025,08,11,2025,08,11,mdi-career fellowship (MCRF16017)_NONE_Victorian Cancer Agency_; NONE_NONE_Cancer Council Victoria Postdoctoral Fellowship_; 2305_NONE_Peter MacCallum Cancer Foundation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40788836,10.1111/febs.70216,40788836,0,,
40905154,Local Adaptation Drives Leaf Thermoregulation in Tropical Rainforest Trees.,"Tropical forests play a critical role in biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and climate regulation, but are increasingly affected by heatwaves and droughts. Vulnerability to warming may vary within and between species because of phenotypic divergence. Leaf trait variation can affect leaf operating temperatures-a phenomenon termed 'limited homeothermy' when it helps avoid heat damage in warmer conditions. However, evidence for this capacity and the relative roles of acclimation or adaptation remain limited. We measured photosynthetic heat tolerance and leaf thermal traits of three co-occurring rainforest tree species across a thermal gradient in the Australian Wet Tropics. Using a leaf energy balance model parameterised with field-measured traits, we predicted variation in leaf-to-air temperature differences (∆T<sub>trait</sub>) and resulting thermal safety margins. We combined this with individual-based genome-wide data to detect signals of adaptive divergence and validated findings in a glasshouse trial with provenances grown under contrasting temperature and humidity conditions. Intraspecific trait variation reduced ∆T<sub>trait</sub> and increased heat tolerance in warmer sites for Darlingia darlingiana and Elaeocarpus grandis, but not Cardwellia sublimis. As a result, thermal safety margins declined less steeply with increasing growth temperature in species capable of increased heat tolerance and avoidance, indicating these strategies can effectively buffer warming. All species showed genomic signals of selection, with associations to temperature and moisture variables. In E. grandis, glasshouse results confirmed a negative cline in ∆T<sub>trait</sub> with temperature of origin. Although contrasting growth temperature and humidity lead to acclimation of individual traits, their coordination maintained ∆T<sub>trait</sub> across the conditions imposed. Our findings provide evidence of limited homeothermy and suggest climate gradients have selected for trait combinations that reduce leaf temperatures at warmer sites in some but not all species. Given the rapid pace of climate change, those species with limited capacity to adjust their thermal safety margins through acclimation or adaptation may be at greater risk of local extinction.","Middleby, Kali B; Jordan, Rebecca; Cheesman, Alexander W; Rossetto, Maurizio; Breed, Martin F; Crayn, Darren M; Cernusak, Lucas A","College of Science and Engineering, Flinders University, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.; ARC Centre of Excellence for Indigenous and Environmental Histories and Futures, James Cook University, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.; Research Centre for Ecosystem Resilience, Australian Institute of Botanic Science, Royal Botanic Garden Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; College of Life and Environmental Science, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Australian Tropical Herbarium, James Cook University, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.; College of Science and Engineering and Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, James Cook University, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.; CSIRO Environment, Sandy Bay, Tasmania, Australia.; AMAP, University of Montpellier, CIRAD, CNRS, INRAE, IRD, Montpellier, France.",Global change biology,Glob Chang Biol,"Rainforest, Plant Leaves, Trees, Tropical Climate, Australia, Acclimatization, Thermotolerance, Adaptation, Physiological, Temperature, Climate Change",2025,09,03,2025,09,06,LP190100484_NONE_Australian Research Council_; NONE_NONE_Skyrail Rainforest Foundation_; DP210103186_NONE_Australian Research Council_; NONE_NONE_James Cook University_; NONE_NONE_Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905154,10.1111/gcb.70461,40905154,0,0,NONE
40788058,Indirect Genomic Predictions for Indicine Cattle Breeds With SNP Effects From a Multi-Breed Genomic Evaluation.,"Indirect predictions (IP) are used for young genotyped animals that lack phenotypes (of their own or from progeny) or are from commercial herds. The former can be left behind because they do not contribute to the official genomic evaluations. The latter are often excluded from the evaluations because they are not registered and may not have pedigree information. Including such animals could result in inflated and biased genomic breeding values (GEBV). In Brazil, pedigree, phenotype and genotype information is scarce for important breeds like Brahman, Guzerat, and Tabapua, while the Nellore breed has a substantial amount of information. IP for young animals of these breeds based on a larger reference population could enhance genomic selection accuracy. Our objective in this study was to compute IP for young genotyped Nellore, Brahman, Guzerat, and Tabapua animals using single- and multi-breed analyses, with or without metafounders (MF) to model genetic differences across breeds. Records from the four breeding programs of the National Association of Breeders and Researchers (ANCP-Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil) were used. Data included pedigree (4.2 M), phenotypes (329 K), and genotypes (63.5 K) across all breeds. The number of genotyped animals within each breed was 58,574 for Nellore, 3102 for Brahman, 1389 for Guzerat, and 427 for Tabapua. The analysed traits were adjusted weight at 210 (W210) and 450 (W450) days of age and the scrotal circumference at 365 (SC365) days of age. IP were derived as the sum of the SNP effects weighted by the gene content using different reference populations: multi-breed with or without MF, Nellore, or within-breed. Scenarios were compared using the linear regression (LR) method for bias, dispersion, and accuracy. Adding MF decreased bias and under- or overdispersion and slightly increased the accuracy of IP. Combining breeds increased the accuracy of IP, mainly benefiting breeds with a small number of genotypes. These findings suggest that when young genotyped animals are not included in an official multi-breed evaluation in zebuine cattle from Brazil, robust IP can be obtained with proper modelling, regardless of the breed. This helps obtain fast genomic predictions for young animals without overwhelming the evaluation system with too many animals.","Londoño-Gil, Marisol; Hidalgo, Jorge; Legarra, Andres; Magnabosco, Claudio U; Baldi, Fernando; Lourenco, Daniela","Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias, Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho, Jaboticabal, São Paulo, Brazil.; Department of Animal and Dairy Science, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA.; Embrapa Cerrados, Brasilia, Brazil.; Council on Dairy Cattle Breeding, Bowie, Maryland, USA.",Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie,J Anim Breed Genet,,2025,08,11,2025,08,11,2020/14275-5_NONE_Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo_; 402313/2021-6_NONE_Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico_; 2022/15168-3_NONE_Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo_; 2021/04807-2_NONE_Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40788058,10.1111/jbg.70008,40788058,0,,
40831018,Genetics and Vitamin D Interactions in Osteoporosis: A Path to Precision Medicine.,"Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk; it poses a significant global health challenge. The multifactorial pathogenesis of osteoporosis involves complex interactions between genetic factors and vitamin D metabolism, particularly involving key genes such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR), CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. Polymorphisms in these genes, including FokI, BsmI, TaqI and ApaI in the VDR gene, have been associated with variations in BMD, fracture susceptibility and differential responses to vitamin D supplementation, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 500 loci, including WNT16, ESR1 and SOST, linked to osteoporosis-related traits, underlining the disease's polygenic nature and the impact of gene-environment interactions, including dietary vitamin D intake, sun exposure and gene variations. Despite these advancements, translating genetic insights into clinical practice remains challenging, especially due to the variability in genetic determinants and limited access to genotype assessment such as gene sequencing. This review advocates for precision medicine approaches to osteoporosis management. By addressing the gaps in the studies on osteoporosis aetiology, integrating genetic screening into routine diagnosis and care and promoting collaborative efforts in genomics, nutrition and public health, the global burden of osteoporosis can be significantly reduced. This approach offers a promising pathway to improve patient outcomes and advance personalized medicine strategies for osteoporosis as a debilitating condition.","Abdollahi, Sepideh; Taheri, Forough; Lahijan, Amirhossein Sangi Nasab; Shoga, Saba Hatefi; Didehban, Ali; Doaei, Saeid","Department of Community Nutrition, Faculty of Nutrition Sciences and Food Technology, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Tehran, Iran.; Metabolic Disorders Research Centre, Endocrinology and Metabolism Molecular-Cellular Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Unit of Nutrition and Cancer, Cancer Epidemiology Research Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat Barcelona, Spain., Barcelona, Spain.; Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran.; Human Genetics Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,J Cell Mol Med,"Humans, Osteoporosis, Precision Medicine, Vitamin D, Genome-Wide Association Study, Receptors, Calcitriol, Bone Density, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase, 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase",2025,08,20,2025,08,23,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40831018,10.1111/jcmm.70780,40831018,1,,[40831018]

Prenatal application of whole exome sequencing (WES) has emerged as a valuable tool to decipher genetic causes in structural abnormalities detected by fetal ultrasound. Here, we reviewed index cases of NIHF whose genetic etiologies were delineated by WES. We conducted a retrospective study on our pilot series (n = 12) of NIHF that underwent WES with outcomes systematically reviewed. For each case, we performed a detailed sonographic examination for anasarca, virology profile, karyotyping, and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), in addition to WES performed either prenatally or postnatally. Between December 2019 and July 2024, 12 fetuses with abnormal fluid accumulation in fetal compartments, despite normal karyotyping and CMA, underwent WES to elucidate potential genetic etiologies. Variant interpretation was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). A definitive molecular diagnosis was established in all 12 cases, with identified disorders including lymphatic abnormalities (33%), musculoskeletal disorders (30%), and syndromic conditions (17%). All recurrent cases (3/3, 100%) and those who received fetal therapy (4/4, 100%) have a definite molecular diagnosis. Two survived fetuses were diagnosed in the first and third trimesters, respectively, while four infants died and six couples decided to terminate the pregnancy due to disease progression. Two novel founder variants (HSPG2 and BBS2) were found. WES is an effective tool to determine the genetic diagnosis of NIHF cases and would discover more novel causative genes to match the prenatal phenotypes exhibited.","Lim, Zhu Wei; Ma, Gwo-Chin; Chang, Ting-Yu; Wu, Wan-Ju; Lee, Mei-Hui; Chen, Ming","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Post-Baccalaureate Medicine, College of Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Genetics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Bioscience Technology, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.; Department of Genomic Medicine and Center for Medical Genetics, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,"Humans, Hydrops Fetalis, Female, Pregnancy, Exome Sequencing, Pilot Projects, Retrospective Studies, Adult, Genetic Counseling, Prenatal Diagnosis, Ultrasonography, Prenatal",2025,08,11,2025,08,11,NSTC-113-2314-B371-012-MY3_NONE_National Science and Technology Council_; NSTC-112-2314-B371-005_NONE_National Science and Technology Council_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40789765,10.1111/jog.70039,40789765,0,,
40891211,Recent Adaptation in a Threatened Salmonid Revealed by Museum Genomics.,"Steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is an imperilled salmonid with two main life history strategies: migrate to the ocean or remain in freshwater. Domesticated hatchery forms of this species have been stocked into almost all California waterways, possibly resulting in introgression into natural populations and altered population structure. We compared whole-genome sequence data from contemporary populations against a set of museum population samples of steelhead from the same locations that were collected prior to most hatchery stocking. We observed minimal introgression and few steelhead-hatchery trout hybrids despite a century of extensive stocking. Our historical data show signals of introgression with a sister species and indications of an early hatchery facility. Finally, we found that migration-associated haplotypes have become less frequent over time, a likely adaptation to decreased opportunities for migration. Since contemporary migration-associated haplotype frequencies have been used to guide species management, we consider this to be a rare example of shifting baseline syndrome that has been validated with historical data. We suggest cautious optimism that a century of hatchery stocking has had minimal impact on California steelhead population genetic structure, but we note that continued shifts in life history may lead to further declines in the ocean-going form of the species.","Sharo, Andrew G; Supple, Megan A; Cabrera, Randy; Seligmann, William E; Sacco, Samuel; Columbus, Cassondra D; Pearse, Devon E; Shapiro, Beth; Garza, John Carlos","Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Department of Ocean Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Santa Cruz, California, USA.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,"Animals, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Genomics, Haplotypes, Genetics, Population, Museums, Endangered Species, Animal Migration, Adaptation, Physiological, California",2025,09,02,2025,09,12,SG23-032b_NONE_Wild Animal Initiative_; 2109912_NONE_Directorate for Biological Sciences_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40891211,10.1111/mec.70063,40891211,0,0,NONE
40787782,Beyond Genetic Indicators: How Reproductive Mode and Hybridisation Challenge Freshwater Mussel Conservation.,"Genetic diversity is a fundamental aspect of biodiversity, yet it is rarely assessed and monitored in conservation practice. Unionid freshwater mussels exemplify the dramatic loss of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems, yet genomic data for these ecologically important species remain scarce. Here, we conducted a high-resolution population genomics study of all Anodonta species in Switzerland, with a focus on two species with contrasting reproductive strategies. After generating draft genomes of the hermaphroditic Anodonta cygnea and the gonochoric Anodonta anatina, we performed whole-genome resequencing of 421 individuals collected in 31 localities. While A. anatina populations followed a metapopulation structure shaped by catchment areas, genetic diversity correlated positively with waterbody size, suggesting greater vulnerability in small ponds compared with large lakes. Inbreeding levels were low; however, effective population sizes were consistently below 100, indicating serious extinction risks. Strong divergence between A. anatina populations north and south of the Alps suggests a putative undescribed Anodonta species in the Ticino area. Furthermore, we detected hybridisation between A. cygnea and A. exulcerata, indicating genomic permeability between these species. In addition, genomic data suggested facultative selfing in A. cygnea, leading to a marked reduction in genetic diversity, increased population structure and inbreeding and a decline in effective population size compared to the outcrossing A. anatina. Our study underscores that reproductive strategy fundamentally shapes genetic indicators of biodiversity and influences extinction risk; conservation targets should therefore be adapted to the biology of the species of interest. To conclude, we advocate for integrating reproductive mode and genomic data into conservation planning to more accurately assess vulnerability and guide effective action.","Faust, Ellika; Conrads, Julie; Giulio, Marco; Ciofi, Claudio; Natali, Chiara; Feulner, Philine G D; Weber, Alexandra A-T","Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Kastanienbaum, Switzerland.; Department of Biology, University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino (FI), Italy.; Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.; Department of Aquatic Ecology, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Dübendorf, Switzerland.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,11,2025,08,11,"NONE_NONE_UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)_; 22.00173_NONE_Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)_; 101059492_NONE_HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme_; NONE_NONE_Eawag Discretionary Funds_; 24.00054_NONE_Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40787782,10.1111/mec.70066,40787782,0,,
40787795,Genealogical Analysis of Replicate Flower Colour Hybrid Zones in Antirrhinum.,"A major goal of speciation research is identifying loci that underpin barriers to gene flow. Population genomics takes a 'bottom-up' approach, scanning the genome for molecular signatures of processes that drive or maintain divergence. However, interpreting the 'genomic landscape' of speciation is complicated, because genome scans conflate multiple processes, most of which are not informative about gene flow. However, studying replicated population contrasts, including multiple incidences of secondary contact, can strengthen inferences. In this paper, we use linked-read sequencing (haplotagging), F<sub>ST</sub> scans and genealogical methods to characterise the genomic landscape associated with replicate hybrid zone formation. We studied two flower colour varieties of the common snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus, that form secondary hybrid zones in multiple independent valleys in the Pyrenees. Consistent with past work, we found very low differentiation at one well-studied zone (Planoles). However, at a second zone (Avellanet), we found stronger differentiation and greater heterogeneity, which we argue is due to differences in the amount of introgression following secondary contact. Topology weighting of genealogical trees identified loci where haplotype diversity was associated with the two snapdragon varieties.

40852761,Quaternary Glaciation Accelerates Speciation in Aquatic Snakes Through Recent Bottlenecks.,"Climatic fluctuations during glacial periods have profoundly shaped the demographic history and gene flow dynamics of many taxa. This study integrated high-throughput sequencing of 67 individuals with comprehensive genomic analyses to investigate biogeographic patterns, genetic divergence and demographic trajectories in the Opisthotropis latouchii species complex, a group of mountain stream snakes distributed across Central China. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic divergence, identifying four distinct lineages, each confined to one of the four major mountain ranges in Central China, including one previously unrecognised species. These lineages exhibited distinct demographic signatures, with population bottlenecks occurring during Quaternary glaciations. Initial isolation in the glacial refugia of the southern regions of these mountains during the Late Pliocene was followed by postglacial expansions along a northward trajectory, with further divergence along a latitudinal gradient associated with mountain distribution. Notably, the mountain ranges of Central China acted as critical refugia during glacial periods, promoting rapid speciation, and as dispersal corridors during interglacial periods, facilitating range expansion and enabling recent gene flow. These findings highlight the profound impact of Quaternary climatic oscillations on genetic structure, demographic history and gene flow patterns of these endemic taxa.","Ren, Jin-Long; Li, Rui-Han; Jia, Ru-Wan; Lyu, Zhi-Tong; Yan, Chaochao; Jiang, Dechun; Wang, Ying-Yong; Li, Jia-Tang","State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol/The Museum of Biology, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.; China-Croatia Belt and Road Joint Laboratory on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China.; Mountain Ecological Restoration and Biodiversity Conservation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, China.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,25,2025,08,25,"071GJHZ2023041MI_NONE_International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences_; 2023YFF1304800_NONE_National Key Program of Research and Development, Ministry of Science and Technology of China_; 2023M743416_NONE_China Postdoctoral Science Foundation_; 32325011_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 32300370_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40852761,10.1111/mec.70071,40852761,0,0,NONE
40787783,"Population Genomics, Local Adaptation and Cryptic Speciation in a Temperate Reef Fish, the Black Surfperch, Embiotoca jacksoni, Using Genome-Wide Resequencing.","The black surfperch, Embiotoca jacksoni , exhibits limited dispersal due to its lack of a pelagic larval stage and offers a unique model for studying local adaptation and potential cryptic speciation in marine species. This study employs medium-coverage whole genome resequencing to explore population structure, local adaptation, and genetic divergence across a latitudinal gradient from central California to Baja California, Mexico, including offshore islands. We identify strong genetic differentiation between five distinct groups: a coastal group and four island groups (Santa Catalina Island, San Clemente Island, Isla Guadalupe, and Isla San Jerónimo), from Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Fst estimation, ancestry (sNMF), and phylogenetic analyses. For coastal populations, genetic structure correlates with geographic distance, following isolation-by-distance (IBD) expectations. Further, we identify numerous outlier loci associated with adaptive traits, particularly genes linked to reproductive isolation, such as Spermine oxidase, Izumo sperm-egg fusion protein 1, and SPAG1, which are involved in fertilisation success. These loci suggest that reproductive barriers are contributing to divergence among genetic groups. The presence of signatures of both genetic drift and selective pressures, particularly in genes governing fertilisation, indicates that these distinct populations may represent incipient or cryptic species. Our findings highlight the role of low dispersal in fostering local adaptation and speciation in marine systems and underscore the potential for rapid evolutionary responses to environmental gradients. This research provides insights into the complex processes of speciation in marine vertebrates, particularly those with limited gene flow, and offers a baseline for monitoring genetic shifts in response to climate change.","Toy, Jason A; Oulès, Arthur; Longo, Gary; Shaffer, H Bradley; Bernardi, Giacomo","Ocean Associates, Inc., Under Contract to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.; La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science, Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA.; École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Université de Lyon, Lyon, France.; Laboratoire de Biologie Tissulaire et Ingénierie Thérapeutique, UMR5305 CNRS/Université Lyon 1, Lyon, France.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,11,2025,08,11,ID RSI-19-690224_NONE_the State of California_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40787783,10.1111/mec.70073,40787783,0,,
40808669,Recombination Rate and Recurrent Linked Selection Shape Correlated Genomic Landscapes Across a Continuum of Divergence in Swallows.,"Disentangling the drivers of genomic divergence during speciation is essential to our broader understanding of the generation of biological diversity. Genetic changes accumulate at variable rates across the genome as populations diverge, leading to heterogenous landscapes of genetic differentiation. The 'islands of differentiation' that characterise these landscapes harbour genetic signatures of the evolutionary processes that led to their formation, providing insight into the roles of these processes in adaptation and speciation. Here, we study swallows in the genus Hirundo to investigate genomic landscapes of differentiation between species spanning a continuum of evolutionary divergence. Genomic differentiation spans a wide range of values (F<sub>ST</sub> = 0.01-0.8) between species, with substantial heterogeneity in genome-wide patterns. Genomic landscapes are strongly correlated among species (ρ = 0.46-0.99), both at shallow and deep evolutionary timescales, with broad evidence for the role of linked selection together with recombination rate in shaping genomic differentiation. Further dissection of genomic islands reveals patterns consistent with a model of 'recurrent selection', wherein differentiation increases due to selection in the same genomic regions in ancestral and descendant populations. Finally, we use measures of the site frequency spectrum to differentiate between alternative forms of selection, providing evidence that genetic hitchhiking due to positive selection has contributed substantially to genomic divergence. Our results demonstrate the pervasive role of recurrent linked selection in shaping genomic divergence despite a history of gene flow and underscore the importance of non-neutral evolutionary processes in predictive frameworks for genomic divergence in speciation genomics studies.","Schield, Drew R; Carter, Javan K; Alderman, Megan G; Farleigh, Keaka; Highland, Dylan K; Safran, Rebecca J","RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,14,2025,08,14,1149942_NONE_Division of Environmental Biology_; 1906188_NONE_Division of Biological Infrastructure_; 2409958_NONE_Division of Biological Infrastructure_; 1856266_NONE_Division of Integrative Organismal Systems_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40808669,10.1111/mec.70074,40808669,0,,
40797267,"Biogeography and Social Family Structure Contribute to Cryptic Genomic Divergence in the Only Obligate Eusocial Beetle Species, Austroplatypus incompertus (Curculionidae: Platypodinae).","Eusociality in insects has arisen multiple times independently in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants), Blattodea (termites) and Coleoptera (beetles). In Hymenoptera and Blattodea, the evolution of eusociality led to species proliferation. In the hyperdiverse Coleoptera, obligate eusociality evolved only once, in the ancient Australian ambrosia beetle Austroplatypus incompertus (Curculionidae: Platypodinae). This species occurs patchily in mesic eucalypt forests of eastern Australia, from Victoria to northern New South Wales, and has a low dispersal capacity. Based on individuals collected from the southern and northern edges of its distribution, it was initially described as two distinct species. However, the names were later synonymised as no morphological differences were found throughout the species' distribution. Recent mitochondrial analyses revealed substantial latitudinal divergence across populations. To address this disparity between morphological and molecular data, we sequenced and analysed a SNP panel of over 6656 biallelic markers from 187 individuals from 11 sites across 1000 km of this species' range. Our data indicate that eusocial demographic processes such as limited dispersal and reliance on few reproductive individuals, together with habitat fragmentation, contributed to the genetic structuring of this species into northern, central and southern lineages. We further identified low levels of introgression between the highly diverged central and northern lineages at a site close to the Hunter Valley biogeographic barrier, possibly due to secondary contact. Our results highlight the interplay of biogeography and life history on the genomic divergence in this unique ambrosia beetle lineage of important standing in the evolution of eusociality in insects.","Bickerstaff, James R M; Jordal, Bjarte H; Riegler, Markus","Australian National Insect Collection, CSIRO, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.; Museum of Natural History, University Museum of Bergen, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, Western Sydney University, Penrith, New South Wales, Australia.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,12,2025,08,13,NONE_NONE_Linnean Society of NSW_; P00021275_NONE_Australian Biological Resources Study_; NONE_NONE_Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40797267,10.1111/mec.70076,40797267,0,,
40827605,Combined Evidence Reveals the Origin of a Rapid Range Expansion Despite Retained Genetic Diversity and a Weak Founder Effect.,"Many species are currently experiencing range shifts in response to changing environmental conditions with potentially serious genetic consequences. Repeated founder events and strong genetic drift are expected to erode genetic variation at the range front, reducing adaptive potential and slowing or even halting the expansion. However, the severity of these consequences for common and highly mobile species undergoing environment-driven range shifts (c.f. invasions) is less clear. Here, we combined historical observations and contemporary movement data of the common reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) with genomic evidence from across its European breeding range to (1) infer the origin and (2) quantify the genetic consequences of a recent and rapid northward range expansion. Although there were no reductions in levels of nucleotide diversity or allelic richness, nor a signal of founder effect in the directionality index (ψ), our combined dataset approach was able to infer an expansion origin from the southwest. Furthermore, we found that private allelic richness retained a slight but significant linear decline along the colonisation route. These results suggest that high dispersal capabilities can allow even philopatric species to avoid the loss of genetic diversity during rapid range expansions. Nevertheless, if multiple lines of evidence enable identification of an expansion pathway, we may still detect genetic signals of expansion.","Bergman, Nora M; Lehikoinen, Petteri; Kluen, Edward; Bensch, Staffan; Lo Cascio Sætre, Camilla; Eroukhmanoff, Fabrice; Fossøy, Frode; Procházka, Petr; Smith, William J; Stokke, Bård G; Primmer, Craig R; Thorogood, Rose; Rönkä, Katja","Department of Biosciences, CEES, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; HiLIFE Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Biology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.; Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.; Finnish Museum of Natural History, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), Trondheim, Norway.; Research Programme in Organismal and Evolutionary Biology, Faculty of Biological & Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,19,2025,08,19,"333801_NONE_Research Council of Finland_; NONE_NONE_Doctoral Programme in Wildlife Biology, University of Helsinki_; NONE_NONE_Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki_; NONE_NONE_Faculty of Sciences, University of Oslo_; 151641/432_NONE_Research Council of Norway_; 347478_NONE_Research Council of Finland_; 68081766_NONE_Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences_; RVO_NONE_Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Czech Academy of Sciences_; NONE_NONE_Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827605,10.1111/mec.70077,40827605,0,,
40799055,Coexistence in Sympatry With Gene Flow Before Speciation Has Completed.,"Incipient species often coexist in sympatry before complete reproductive isolation has evolved between them. How do they persist in the face of hybridization and gene flow? The challenge is more acute than ordinary ecological coexistence not only because gene flow erodes and recombines genetic differences, but also because selection against hybrids can destabilise population sizes. We estimated gene flow and selection against hybrid genotypes between sympatric limnetic and benthic species of threespine stickleback in two British Columbia lakes. First-generation hybrids are present at a rate of about 2%. To estimate selection, we compared the frequency distribution of ancestry proportions between juvenile and adult samples. We also used genomic simulation with assortative mating in an ecological model to determine how much selection is required to reproduce observed genotype frequencies. Results from the two approaches were comparable and yielded estimated selection coefficients S against the least fit ancestry proportion (within backcross range) between 0.5 and 0.6. Surprisingly, selection was found to be only slightly weaker than that leading readily to collapse and fusion in our simulations, suggesting that sympatric stickleback species are close to a coexistence boundary. Moderately strong selection appears to be required for coexistence with even low levels of gene flow. We suggest that larger niche differences are required to stabilise coexistence with gene flow than without gene flow. This helps to explain why successful sympatric species that hybridise often show conspicuous ecological and phenotypic differences.","Schluter, Dolph; Veen, Thor; Thompson, Ken A; Owens, Greg L; Rennison, Diana J","Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.; Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.; School of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Zoology Department, and Biodiversity Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,13,2025,08,13,NONE_NONE_University of British Columbia_; NONE_NONE_Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40799055,10.1111/mec.70079,40799055,0,,
40801356,Museum Genomics Reveals Temporal Genetic Stasis and Global Genetic Diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Global patterns of population genetic variation through time offer a window into evolutionary processes that maintain diversity. Over time, lineages may expand or contract their distribution, causing turnover in population genetic composition. At individual loci, migration, drift and selection (among other processes) may affect allele frequencies. Museum specimens of widely distributed species offer a unique window into the genetics of understudied populations and changes over time. Here, we sequenced genomes of 130 herbarium specimens and 91 new field collections of Arabidopsis thaliana and combined these with published genomes. We sought a broader view of genomic diversity across the species and to test if population genomic composition is changing through time. We documented extensive and previously uncharacterised diversity in a range of populations in Africa, populations that are under threat from anthropogenic climate change. Through time, we did not find dramatic changes in genomic composition of populations. Instead, we found a pattern of genetic change every 100 years of the same magnitude seen when comparing Eurasian populations that are 185 km apart, potentially due to a combination of drift and changing selection. We found only mixed signals of polygenic adaptation at phenology and physiology QTL. We did find that genes conserved across eudicots show altered levels of directional allele frequency change, potentially due to variable purifying and background selection.

40856093,Persistent Genomic Erosion in Whooping Cranes Despite Demographic Recovery.,"Integrating in-situ (wild) and ex-situ (captive) conservation efforts can mitigate genetic diversity loss and help prevent extinction of endangered wild populations. The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating in a collapse to ~20 individuals by 1944. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the census population from a stock of 16 individuals to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality reference genome, and re-sequencing 16 historical (years 1867-1893) and 37 modern (2007-2020) genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its historical genetic diversity and has increased its inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realised load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and persistent effects of historical inbreeding (i.e., background inbreeding) argue against the species' downlisting from its current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realised load. Our findings emphasise the role of genomics in informing conservation management and policy.","Fontsere, Claudia; Speak, Samuel A; Caven, Andrew J; Rodríguez, Juan Antonio; Wang, Xuejing; Pacheco, Carolina; Cassatt-Johnstone, Molly; Femerling, Georgette; Maloney, Brigid; Balacco, Jennifer; Collins, Joanna; Sims, Ying; Abueg, Linelle; Fedrigo, Olivier; Jarvis, Erich D; Hartup, Barry K; Shapiro, Beth; Gilbert, M Thomas P; van Oosterhout, Cock; Morales, Hernán E","International Crane Foundation, Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA.; North of England Zoological Society, Chester Zoo, Chester, UK.; School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.; Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Natural History Museum, London, UK.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Vertebrate Genome Lab, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.; University Museum, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.; School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.; Crane Trust, Wood River, Nebraska, USA.; Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Biology Department, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,08,26,2025,08,26,"NONE_HHMI_Howard Hughes Medical Institute_United States; NONE_NONE_U.S. Geological Survey_; BB/X019683/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; 101078303_NONE_H2020 European Research Council_; 100162318RA1(RTSG)_NONE_Natural Environment Research Council_; BB/S019669/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; T209447_NONE_Natural Environment Research Council_; ResQ, Project 101107083_NONE_European Union - Research Executive Agency_; NONE_NONE_Chester Zoo_; 681396_NONE_H2020 European Research Council_; DNRF143_NONE_Danmarks Grundforskningsfond_; NONE_NONE_National Research Foundation_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40856093,10.1111/mec.70088,40856093,0,0,NONE
40905139,Characterisation of the Historic Demographic Decline of the British European Polecat Population.,"The European polecat (Mustela putorius) has a widespread distribution across many countries of mainland Europe but is documented to be declining within these ranges. In Britain, direct persecution led to a severe decline of the polecat population during the 19th century. Unlike European mainland populations, it is now recovering across much of its former British range. The genomic and conservation implications of such a severe demographic decline, followed by the current recovery, have still to be characterised in the European polecat in Britain. Here we carry out population-level whole-genome analyses of 65 polecats from Britain (Wales and England) and the European mainland. Our analyses reveal that Welsh polecats show genetic variability from both English and European polecats, while British polecats as a whole exhibit signs of genetic isolation from mainland European populations. We also reconstructed the demographic history of the Welsh polecat to quantify the magnitude of the bottleneck. Our analyses confirmed the drastic decline of the Welsh polecat's effective population size, with a severe genetic bottleneck around 30-40 generations ago (1854-894). We investigated whether whole-genome diversity reflected this demographic event and found that Welsh polecats had significantly less genetic diversity than English polecats, but not European polecats. Runs of homozygosity and genetic load present in Welsh and English polecat genomes also indicated recent historic inbreeding. Our findings suggest that the increase in the British polecat population size may be attributed to admixture events. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Welsh polecat constitutes a genetically distinct population, which could be crucial for the overall conservation of European polecats by preserving unique genetic diversity.","Shaw, R; MacPherson, J; Kitchener, A C; Etherington, G J; Haerty, W","Department of Natural Sciences, National Museums Scotland, Edinburgh, UK.; School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.; Vincent Wildlife Trust, Ledbury, Herefordshire, UK.; University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, UK.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,09,04,2025,09,04,BB/CCG1720/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBX011070/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/ER/230003C_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBX011089/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/T/000PR9816_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/ER/230003A_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/ER/230001A_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/ER/230001B_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBS/E/ER/230001C_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; BBX011003/1_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; NONE_NONE_Negaunee Foundation_; BBS/E/ER/230002A_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; NE/S007334/1_NONE_Natural Environment Research Council_; BBS/E/ER/230002B_BB__Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council_United Kingdom; NONE_NONE_UK Research and Innovation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905139,10.1111/mec.70091,40905139,0,0,NONE
40916579,Patterns of Genetic Diversity Within Three California Quail Species Are Best Explained by Climate and Landscape Changes.,"Many North American game animals experienced severe population declines during the 19th century due to market hunting. However, estimates of the timing and magnitude of these declines often rely on anecdotal evidence, which makes it difficult to understand the lasting impacts of hunting pressures versus climate or landscape changes on the genetic diversity of contemporary populations. Historical reports suggest the California quail (Callipepla californica) suffered more significant hunting pressure in the late 19th century relative to either Gambel's (Callipepla gambelii) or mountain quail (Oreortyx pictus). Genomic data can help illuminate the extent to which historical exploitation moulded the genetic health of modern quail populations. We compared whole genome sequences from these three quail species to evaluate whether reported differences in hunting pressure affected contemporary patterns of genetic diversity. Contrary to our expectations, California quail did not exhibit any evidence for population declines until the late 20th century, long after the era of market hunting ended. California quail also exhibited the highest levels of genetic diversity across most analyses with evidence for population expansion over the past 500,000 years. In contrast, the mountain quail exhibited a long-term population decline beginning in the middle of the last ice age 30-40 thousand years ago. The Gambel's quail appears to have suffered a more recent bottleneck in association with a major drought that impacted the desert southwest during the mid-20th century. Gambel's quail also exhibited increased realised genetic load for mild and moderately deleterious genetic variants. Together, our results demonstrate that market hunting had little lasting impact on the genetic diversity of these quail species, whereas landscape and climate changes have led to fluctuations in effective population size (Ne) and the buildup of genetic load.","Benham, Phred M; Cicero, Carla; Davila, Michelle M; Enbody, Erik D; Miller, Katherine S; Shultz, Allison J; Smith, Lydia L; Nachman, Michael W; Bowie, Rauri C K","Department of Computational Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.; Department of Biomolecular Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, USA.; Department of Integrative Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; Ornithology Department, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; California Department of Fish and Wildlife, West Sacramento, California, USA.",Molecular ecology,Mol Ecol,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,UC Award ID RSI-19-690224_NONE_California Conservation Genomics Project_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916579,10.1111/mec.70093,40916579,0,0,NONE
40790820,Engineering the plant circadian clock for latitudinal adaptation as a strategy to secure agricultural productivity on a changing planet.,"Climate change is driving droughts, floods, heatwaves, and new diseases impacting different crop species in different parts of the globe. However, these are local symptoms of a global disease that is also causing planet-wide changes that threaten food production. Warming-induced shifts in climatic niches, including the rapid poleward migration of our most productive agricultural zones, are necessitating the creation of medium to high latitude-adapted germplasm for staple crops. Advances in plant chronobiology and crop population genomics show that core clock genes played a historically serendipitous role in adapting major crops to new latitudes during the process of domestication and breeding. In this Tansley insight, we argue that rapid latitudinal adaptation of crops in the future is possible via the targeted engineering of morning-, afternoon-, and evening-expressed circadian regulators in crop plants with distinct phenologies. We envision a latitudinal breeding pipeline incorporating knowledge from multi-location crop population genomics studies and harnessing gene editing and synthetic biology to rapidly prototype climate-smart varieties and speed up the de novo domestication of crop wild relatives. Building a climate-smart agricultural system requires engineering plant chronobiology to reach the ambitious goal of creating germplasm adapted for greater seasonal and geographical flexibility.","Gerhardt, Aisha; Mehta, Devang","Leuven Plant Institute, KU Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium.; Leuven Institute of Single Cell Omics, KU Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium.; Department of Biosystems, KU Leuven, Leuven, 3000, Belgium.",The New phytologist,New Phytol,,2025,08,11,2025,08,12,11PIS24N_NONE_Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek_; 3E221256_NONE_KU Leuven Bijzonder Onderzoeksfond_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790820,10.1111/nph.70420,40790820,0,,

Whole-genome resequencing revealed high genomic similarity across southern China due to multiple introductions and introgression. Regulatory plasticity in the auxin signaling pathway (miR167a-ARF8) might provide a competitive advantage for M. micrantha. Mikania micrantha exhibited a higher copy number and expression of benzoxazinoids biosynthesis-related genes compared to M. cordata, potentially enhancing its defensive capabilities. This study provides new genomic insights into the invasive success of M. micrantha and suggests that targeting the auxin signaling pathway may offer a promising strategy for controlling the spread of this invasive weed.","Wang, Ruonan; Wang, Zhen; Ruan, Xiaoxian; Peng, Yang; Sang, Yatong; Liao, Wenbo; Wang, Ting; Su, Yingjuan","Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, 518057, Shenzhen, China.; College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, 510642, Guangzhou, China.; School of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen University, 518107, Shenzhen, China.; School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.",The New phytologist,New Phytol,,2025,08,16,2025,08,16,"JCYJ20240813150103005_NONE_Project of Department of Science and Technology of Shenzhen City, Guangdong, China_; JCYJ20230807110359040_NONE_Project of Department of Science and Technology of Shenzhen City, Guangdong, China_; 32071781_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 2021A1515010911_NONE_Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province_; JCYJ20210324141000001_NONE_Project of Department of Science and Technology of Shenzhen City, Guangdong, China_; 202206010107_NONE_Science and Technology Projects in Guangzhou_; NONE_NONE_Research Project of the Reform about Teaching Method and Skills from Sun Yat-Sen University and Guangdong Province_; 31872670_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40817690,10.1111/nph.70448,40817690,0,,
40826922,Whole genome sequencing of historical specimens from the world's largest fungal collection yields high-quality assemblies.,"High-throughput molecular studies of museum specimens (museomics) have great potential in biodiversity research, but fungal historical collections have scarcely been examined, leading to no comprehensive methodological assessments. Here we present a whole genome sequencing (WGS) project conducted at the Fungarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. DNA was extracted from 2104 specimens collected between 1770 and 2023, and we found that the specimen age had the smallest effect, while DNA purification and taxonomic identity had the greatest effect on DNA yield. We barcoded 771 specimens, and WGS was conducted on a subset of 394 specimens that were empirically selected for in-depth analysis. We developed an automated assembly pipeline, integrating 16 different approaches. Starting from 220 libraries (excluding lichenised specimens), we produced 3143 assemblies using these approaches and found that there is no universal assembly method that can provide good-quality genomes for all; rather, different approaches should be used depending on the library size and the specimen's age. Producing high-quality genomes from specimens over 100 yr old is possible by using customised DNA extraction protocols and applying a multimethod bioinformatic approach. Whole genomes from historical collections will enrich genomics resources, accelerating biodiversity and evolutionary research, amongst others.","Varga, Torda; Woods, Roseina; Pitsillides, Frances; Hill, Rowena; Biketova, Alona Yu; Llewellyn, Theo; Shaw, Brandon J P; Hodgson, Emily; Wong, Brigid; Le, Jasmine; Becker, Josepha; Bradshaw, Alexander J; Blake, Seth L E; Geeves, Clementine; Levicky, Quentin; Goodman, Lottie; Mole, Ruben L; Reed, Sidney L; Lin, M Carly; Read, Emily; Harris, Keenan; Pino-Bodas, Raquel; Nagy, László G; Bazzicalupo, Anna; Gaya, Ester","Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Richmond, TW9 3DS, UK.; Earlham Institute, Norwich, Norfolk, NR4 7UZ, UK.; Biology Department, Clark University, Worcester, MA, 01610, USA.; Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit, Institute of Biochemistry, HUN-REN Biological Research Centre, 6726, Szeged, Hungary.; Departamento de Biología y Geología, Física y Química Inorgánica, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC), Tulipán s/n, 28933, Móstoles, Spain.; Instituto de Investigación en Cambio Global (IICG-URJC), Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Tulipán s/n, 28933, Móstoles, Spain.; Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus, Ascot, Berkshire, SL5 7PY, UK.",The New phytologist,New Phytol,,2025,08,18,2025,08,19,"NONE_NONE_Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK Government_; BMT35-2019_NONE_Bentham-Moxon Trust_; NONE_NONE_Evolution Education Trust_; BMT46-2022_NONE_Bentham-Moxon Trust_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40826922,10.1111/nph.70472,40826922,0,,
40919705,The genetic architecture and spatiotemporal dynamics of adaptation across human-modified landscapes.,"Understanding the rate and nature of adaptation is crucial for managing biodiversity across our changing landscapes. This perspective synthesizes insights from resistance evolution - a case of rapid, repeated adaptation to extreme human-mediated selection - to reveal how adaptive genetic architectures determine and feedback with evolutionary dynamics. Recent population genomic and quantitative genetic approaches have demonstrated that the extent of genetic parallelism and reliance on de novo vs standing genetic variation can vary with the complexity of genetic architectures. However, we are only starting to understand how spatial and temporal heterogeneity influence the importance of alternative genetic architectures within and among populations, and the pace of adaptation across scales. I outline how the integration of landscape-scale population genomics with high-resolution genomic time series has the potential to transform our understanding of these phenomena. With careful consideration of their limitations, spatiotemporal approaches should prove powerful for reconstructing and predicting the adaptive dynamics of populations across increasingly variable geographic landscapes - from pesticide resistance to climate adaptation.","Kreiner, Julia M","Department of Ecology & Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.",The New phytologist,New Phytol,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40919705,10.1111/nph.70520,40919705,0,0,NONE

We performed whole-genome sequencing and population genomic analyses on Ulmus elongata L. K. Fu & C. S. Ding, an endangered Tertiary relict tree endemic to East Asia. By integrating genomes from U. elongata and seven other endangered trees from public databases, we identified rate-decelerated genes across endangered trees and genes under positive selection of U. elongata associated with tissue development, detoxification, and immune response, and signal transduction and regulation mechanisms potentially leading to endangered status. Demographic analyses revealed continuous population decline from the late Miocene to present, especially during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and last 10 000 years. Spearman correlation indicated a strong negative relationship between effective population size and human population density (r<sub>population density</sub> = -0.90, P < 0.001) as well as cropland use (r<sub>cropland use</sub> = -0.89, P < 0.001). Genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses identified a set of candidate genes associated with temperature and precipitation, supporting a polygenic adaptation model in U. elongata. Overall, our findings underscore the severe population bottlenecks that have led to the fixation of strongly deleterious mutations and inbreeding, further compromising the adaptive potential and long-term viability of U. elongata. Furthermore, assessments of genomic vulnerability under future climate scenarios revealed higher genetic offsets in northern region of Fujian and Jiangxi populations, suggesting these regions require prioritized conservation efforts due to reduced adaptive capacity.","Lin, Nan; Wang, Yakun; Landis, Jacob B; Wang, Xiankun; He, Yuxuan; Wang, Hengchang; Huang, Xianhan; Liu, Qun; Yang, Jun; Shang, Fude; Deng, Tao; Liu, Yanpei","College of Landscape Architecture and Art, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450046, China.; Jiangxi Wuyuan Forest Bird National Nature Reserve Management Center, Shangrao, Jiangxi, 333201, China.; CAS Key Laboratory of Plant Germplasm Enhancement and Specialty Agriculture, Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China.; Henan Engineering Research Center for Osmanthus Germplasm Innovation and Resource Utilization, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450046, China.; School of Integrative Plant Science, Section of Plant Biology and the L.H.

40884163,Genome sequencing and population genetics provide insights into local adaptation of Opisthopappus species on cliff environments of Taihang Mountains.,"Local adaptation represents a pivotal theme in evolutionary biology. The Opisthopappus genus, comprising Opisthopappus longilobus and O. taihangensis, thrives on the cliffs of the Taihang Mountains. During their evolutionary history, two species are hypothesized to have locally adapted to their cliff habitats. In the present study, we employed a combined approach of whole-genome sequencing of O. taihangensis and population genomic analysis from both species to gain deeper insights into their patterns of local adaptation. Our results revealed that the expansive genome of O. taihangensis (3010.18 Mb), a consequence of a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event, coupled with a high proportion of repetitive sequences (82.70%), was postulated as one of its adaptive strategies. A clear differentiation between O. taihangensis and O. longilobus was observed, with the two species diverging approximately 17.57 million years ago (Mya), with O. longilobus serving as the ancestor. Since their divergence, limited gene flow was observed between the two species. Post-divergence, the effective population sizes of both species expanded, yet underwent a dramatic reduction at approximately 0.07 Mya. Furthermore, a total of 798 adaptive genes were identified, of which 207 overlapped with expanded genes, and eight genes were found to be under positive selection. These genes primarily regulated the growth and development of both species via pathways such as oxidation-reduction and ubiquitin-proteasome, enabling them to withstand climate changes. These findings provide profound insights into the local adaptation of Opisthopappus species to the cliff environments and offer valuable clues for further exploring the local adaptation among various cliff-dwelling organisms.","Wang, Yiling; Han, Mian; Ye, Hang; Zhang, Hao; Dan, Haoyuan; Wang, Tingyu; Geng, Fangdong; Sun, Genlou","Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, 710069, China.; Department of Botany, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 3C3, Canada.; School of Life Science, Shanxi Normal University, Taiyuan, 030031, China.",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,Plant J,"Adaptation, Physiological, Genetics, Population, Genome, Plant, Ecosystem, China, Whole Genome Sequencing, Gene Flow, Phylogeny, Evolution, Molecular",2025,08,21,2025,08,30,"202403021221166_NONE_Fundamental Research Program of Shanxi Province, China_; 31970358_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40884163,10.1111/tpj.70446,,,,
40911433,The cardiac pacemakers: A paradigm of robustness in evolutionary biology.,"The cardiac pacemaker activity is formed from multiple interlocking physiological networks, any one of which can generate rhythm. The interlocking is reciprocal so that they automatically replace each other. In such interlocking control systems, the association scores for individual components are necessarily low, even though causation, measured by the electric current carried by the relevant ion channels, is large. This kind of reciprocally based robustness is widespread in living organisms, which explains why most association scores in genome-wide association studies are low, or even zero. It also explains why the polygenic scores do not reliably predict disease states. Genomics alone is therefore a poor method for the discovery of treatments for polygenic diseases. Reliance on genomics has led to a gene-centric impasse in healthcare, which requires a shift in favour of physiological studies that can reveal genuine causation rather than just association. The case for such a shift includes understanding that DNA is not a good self-replicator in very large genomes. Self-replication of DNA and RNA in purely chemical environments confirms that fact. The error rate would amount to hundreds of thousands in a genome of three billion base pairs. Living cells can orchestrate the enzymes necessary for nearly perfect replication before cell division by correcting those errors. These cellular proof-reading processes also open the way to control processes that are used to generate new DNA sequences when the immune and other systems need to do so.","Noble, Denis","Department of Physiology, Anatomy & Genetics, University of Oxford and Daegu-Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea.",The Journal of physiology,J Physiol,,2025,09,05,2025,09,05,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40911433,10.1113/JP287139,40911433,0,0,NONE

This pattern was validated in two independent datasets. Potential clinical relevance uncovered by our analyses included accurate detection of alphapapillomaviruses [human papillomavirus (HPV)] in oral cancers, when compared with current clinical standards, and the detection of rare, highly pathogenic viruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus-1.

While it was first reported a century ago in Asia, its first report in Africa was in the 1980s. Since then, it has been discovered in several countries of both East and West Africa. In this study, we used a combination of genomics and genotyping tools to shed light on its global and local diversity and population structure with a focus on West Africa. Our findings group <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i> strains into three clades, an Asian, an East African-Asian, and a West African clade, and provide evidence of several introduction events from Asia being at the origin of outbreaks in East Africa and probably in West Africa. Our results further highlight the role of human activities in the local spread of this pathogen and the possible role of several wild rice species and weeds as reservoirs. Finally, our results globally support a clonal evolution of <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i>. However, coinfection of plants with distinct strains of <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i>, observed in Mali and Senegal, may facilitate some degree of genetic exchange.IMPORTANCEWest Africa has faced a rapid expansion of rice cultivation with importation of rice varieties mostly from Asia, and rice now constitutes 37% of the cereal consumed in the region. The bacterial pathogen <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i> (<i>Xoc</i>) is causing bacterial leaf streak and threatening rice production in West Africa. Little is known about the pathogen's reservoirs and its modes and routes of dissemination.

Here, we dissect 935 <i>Salmonella</i> isolates, collected from both clinical and food chain sources, through integrated genomics and phenomics to resolve population structure, spatiotemporal dynamics, and evolutionary drivers. <i>Salmonella Typhimurium</i> (18.7%) and <i>Salmonella Enteritidis</i> (17.1%) dominate the serotype landscape, while MLST uncovers ST34 (20.7%) as the pivotal sequence type bridging multiple serotypes. Temporal tracking (2018-2022) exposes alarming AMR trajectories: ciprofloxacin resistance doubled (15.3% to 30.4%) by 2020, and tetracycline resistance peaked at 77.3%. The serotype-specific epidemiology reveals that <i>S. Typhimurium</i> declined and then stabilized, <i>S. Enteritidis</i> fluctuated due to vaccination, and <i>S.

40810579,Colorectal cancer-associated <i>Streptococcus gallolyticus</i>: a hidden diversity expose.,"<i>Streptococcus gallolyticus</i> subsp. <i>gallolyticus</i> (<i>SGG</i>) is a bacterial pathogen implicated in bacteremia and endocarditis and is often associated with colon tumors in elderly individuals. The development of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been linked to intestinal dysbiosis, characterized by increased proportions of <i>SGG</i> and other intestinal microbes. In this study, we present the complete nucleotide sequence of five novel clinical isolates of <i>SGG</i> associated with colorectal cancer, revealing unexpected genetic diversity. Sequencing an additional 30 <i>SGG</i> clinical isolates provided a more comprehensive description of this genetic diversity. We did not identify a pathogenicity island specific to CRC-associated <i>SGG</i> isolates. Most of these human-derived <i>SGG</i> isolates exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics. Our findings also offer additional insights into multilocus sequence typing (MLST), capsular loci, and pilus organization. Analysis of the repertoire of surface proteins reveals high potential for binding and foraging complex polysaccharides. Finally, comparative genomics with the phylogenetically closest non-pathogenic subspecies <i>S. gallolyticus</i> subsp. <i>macedonicus</i> confirmed that <i>SGG</i> pathogenicity-associated factors mostly rely on a large repertoire of surface proteins involved in host colonization, presence of C5a peptidase to avoid innate immunity, bile salt hydrolase to persist in the gut, and of specific bacteriocin and type VII-dependent effectors to colonize the host colon. Additionally, the presence of extracellular polysaccharides in <i>SGG</i> probably helps the bacterium survive in harsher conditions.IMPORTANCE<i>Streptococcus gallolyticus</i> subsp. <i>gallolyticus</i> (<i>SGG</i>) was the first intestinal bacterium associated with colorectal cancer.

For example, the oncogenic role of <i>Escherichia coli pks</i>+ and enterotoxinogenic <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> in colorectal cancer has been well established, identifying the role of genetic loci encoding toxins. Through the sequencing and analysis of 11 clinical <i>SGG</i> isolates from CRC patients and comparisons with non-CRC isolates, we uncovered a significant diversity among CRC-associated strains. Our findings suggest that <i>SGG</i> association with CRC is complex and is not linked to a specific strain or pathogenicity island, thus highlighting the opportunistic and versatile nature of <i>SGG</i>.","Périchon, Bruno; Cokelaer, Thomas; Teh, Wooi Keong; du Merle, Laurence; Ma, Laurence; Touchon, Marie; Doloy, Alexandra; Poyart, Claire; Givskov, Michael; Trieu-Cuot, Patrick; Dramsi, Shaynoor","Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Microbial Evolutionary Genomics, CNRS UMR3525, Paris, France.; Departement of Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Costerton Biofilm Center, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Université Paris Cité, CNRS UMR8104, Inserm U1016, Institut Cochin, Bacterial Pathogenesis and Innate Immune Signaling Team, Paris, France.; Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpitaux universitaires de Paris Centre-site Cochin Service de Bacteriologie, Centre National de Référence des Streptocoques, Paris, France.; Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.; Institut Pasteur, Plateforme technologique Biomics, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Unité de Biologie des Bactéries Pathogènes à Gram-Positif, Paris, France.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, INSERM U1201, Unité de Parasitologie moléculaire et Signalisation, Paris, France.",Journal of bacteriology,J Bacteriol,"Humans, Colorectal Neoplasms, Genetic Variation, Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, Streptococcal Infections, Phylogeny, Genome, Bacterial, Multilocus Sequence Typing, Genomic Islands, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Aged",2025,08,14,2025,09,18,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40810579,10.1128/jb.00230-25,40810579,0,,
40844265,Oxford Nanopore Technologies R10 sequencing enables accurate cgMLST-based bacterial outbreak investigation of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> when accounting for methylation-related errors.,"Core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) is a well-established and standardized method for genomics-based cluster detection and phylogenomic analysis of bacteria. The reduced error rate of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10 sequencing has prompted many laboratories to explore incorporating this technology into their activities. However, conflicting reports exist on the performance of ONT R10 sequencing for cgMLST analysis. This study evaluates the suitability of ONT R10 data for cgMLST allele calling and cluster detection for bacterial outbreak investigation. ONT and Illumina sequencing data were generated for 24 <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> and 24 <i>Salmonella enterica</i> isolates. For ONT, both the rapid barcoding kit (RBK) and the rapid PCR barcoding kit (RPB) were used. The percentage of loci called in the ONT-only assemblies was very high for both species. However, the proportion of mismatched alleles to the hybrid assemblies was substantially higher for the <i>Neisseria</i> ONT-only assemblies with the RBK kit, resulting in incorrect cluster assignments. The large majority of these mismatched alleles were due to incorrect base calls at methylated positions, which did not affect the ONT data generated using the RPB kit or any of the <i>Salmonella</i> ONT-only assemblies. In conclusion, ONT R10 sequencing shows great potential as a viable method for cgMLST analysis, but methylation-related errors can affect performance for certain species and strains. When properly corrected for, ONT R10 had the same performance for cgMLST analysis as Illumina, and both could be used interchangeably. These results support the integration of ONT R10 sequencing into routine public health and clinical workflows. This study evaluates the suitability of Oxford Nanopore Technologies R10 sequencing for core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST), a widely used method in (clinical) outbreak investigation and bacterial strain tracking. We have sequenced 24 <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> and 24 <i>Salmonella enterica</i> strains, including confirmed outbreak cases, using Illumina and ONT R10 sequencing to evaluate the performance for cgMLST analysis. We used a PCR-based and native barcoding protocol for the ONT sequencing, which enabled us to demonstrate a substantial species-dependent impact of methylation-related errors on the performance. However, we demonstrate that when these errors are properly addressed, ONT R10 can be used for accurate cgMLST-based clustering, including integration with strains sequenced using Illumina. Our findings support the use of ONT R10 as an alternative to Illumina sequencing for cgMLST analysis in routine public health practice.","Bogaerts, Bert; Maex, Margo; Commans, Florian; Goeders, Nathalie; Van den Bossche, An; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J; Roosens, Nancy H C; Ceyssens, Pieter-Jan; Mattheus, Wesley; Vanneste, Kevin","Transversal activities in Applied Genomics, Sciensano, Brussels, Belgium.; Bacterial Diseases, Sciensano, Brussels, Belgium.",Journal of clinical microbiology,J Clin Microbiol,,2025,08,22,2025,08,22,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40844265,10.1128/jcm.00410-25,40844265,0,0,NONE

We present a modular, hands-on curriculum designed for high school and early undergraduate students (ages 14-21) that introduces key genomics concepts through an experiment on fermentation, a process that is key to food preservation and medicine. Students follow a complete scientific process: exploring what DNA is and how microbial succession works, analyzing real DNA sequencing data, and writing a formal scientific report. The course integrates molecular biology, bioinformatics, and data analysis obtained from portable nanopore sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore MinION), giving students access to authentic data sets. Activities such as microbial species identification using taxonomic IDs foster skills in observation, experimental design, and quantitative reasoning. The curriculum aligns with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Vision and Change (V&C) frameworks, supporting interdisciplinary learning and scientific literacy.

40815167,Defining the host dependencies and the transcriptional landscape of RSV infection.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing.IMPORTANCERespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV-infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.","Sunshine, Sara; Puschnik, Andreas; Retallack, Hanna; Laurie, Matthew T; Liu, Jamin; Peng, Duo; Knopp, Kristeene; Zinter, Matt S; Ye, Chun Jimmie; DeRisi, Joseph L","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Gladstone-UCSF Institute of Genomic Immunology, San Francisco, California, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Bakar Aging Research Institute (BARI), University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, San Francisco, California, USA.; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Arc Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA.",mBio,mBio,"Humans, Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Single-Cell Analysis, CRISPR-Cas Systems, Gene Expression Profiling",2025,08,15,2025,09,13,P30 AR070155_AR_NIAMS NIH HHS_United States; P01 AI172523_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; F31AI150007_NONE_National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases_; U01 DE028891_DE_NIDCR NIH HHS_United States; UM1 HG012076_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; NONE_NONE_Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco_; F31 AI150007_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI171184_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; T32 AI060537_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40815167,10.1128/mbio.01010-25,40815167,0,,
40853111,"Investigating genetic, antigenic, and structural diversity in the <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> outer membrane protein, PorB: implications for vaccine design.","Vaccines targeting <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> are needed to reduce disease burden and help address the problem of antimicrobial resistance, with an understanding of relationships between gonococcal genetics and molecules influencing diversity, infection, and the immune response essential for developing effective vaccine formulations. Whole-genome sequence data can be used to investigate these relationships among thousands of gonococcal isolates, allowing the study of antigenic diversity on a population scale. Such analyses typically examine antigenic diversity occurring in complete protein sequences, generating mean diversity indices and phylogenetic analyses that can inform on vaccine potential; however, to detect and measure the immune responses elicited, epitope characterization within an antigen helps guide vaccine formulations, with epitopes commonly located in surface-exposed regions of a protein. Here, we analyzed the genetic diversity of the major gonococcal antigen, PorB, in WGS from 22,227 <i>N</i>. <i>gonorrhoeae</i> isolates. We characterized the diversity of all eight surface-exposed outer membrane loops, or variable regions (VRs), and generated a PorB VR subtyping scheme to facilitate the global and temporal detection of circulating PorB subtypes. These analyses identified the presence of dominant VR combinations that persisted over time, indicative of (i) epistatic interactions between VRs and (ii) positive selection. Strain-specific, anti-PorB IgG responses directed toward distinct VR subtypes were detected in sera obtained from participants vaccinated with 4CMenB. The deconstruction of PorB into each surface-exposed loop provides a powerful approach for evaluating vaccine candidates: the methods used here allow immunodominant regions to be detected, which is invaluable for further vaccine investigations. In the context of rising global gonorrhea cases, the development of vaccines becomes a priority; however, <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> antigenic diversity and its ability to evade the immune system complicate vaccine development. This study characterizes the genetic diversity of the outer membrane protein, PorB, a key component of the outer membrane and a major gonococcal antigen. Using genomics and machine-learning techniques, this research identified dominant PorB variants that drive the immune response, proposing potential vaccine candidates and improving our understanding of the evolutionary forces maintaining genome structure and biological fitness. Understanding these processes is crucial for designing vaccines that effectively target <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> and combat the spread of multidrug-resistant gonococci.","Harrison, Odile B; Bash, Margaret; Ramirez-Bencomo, Fidel; Thistlethwaite, Angela; Jones, Rebekah; Stejskal, Lenka; Sanders, Eduard; Feavers, Ian M; Jerse, Ann; Derrick, Jeremy P; Tang, Christoph M; Maiden, Martin C J","Department of Biology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC, USA.; The Aurum Institute, Johannesburg, South Africa.; School of Biological Sciences, Lydia Beck Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.",mBio,mBio,,2025,08,25,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40853111,10.1128/mbio.01309-25,40853111,0,0,NONE
40823842,Siderophore systems at play: system interactions as drivers of diversification in pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i>.,"The <i>irp</i>-HPI genomic island encodes the salicylate-type siderophore piscibactin, a key virulence factor in several pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> species. To advance our understanding of the siderophore metabolome (siderome) in <i>Vibrio anguillarum</i>, we combined high-resolution metabolomics with genetic and phenotypic analyses of biosynthetic mutants. LC-MS/MS and Feature-Based Molecular Networking (FBMN) revealed the presence of known siderophores, vanchrobactin and piscibactin/photoxenobactin-like siderophores, alongside two non-reported catecholate analogs of the formed siderophores, 2-hydroxypiscibactin (2-OH-Pcb) and 2-hydroxyphotoxenobactin E (2-OH-PxbE). Functional characterization of mutants defective in piscibactin or vanchrobactin production demonstrated biosynthetic and uptake-level interactions between these systems. We show that the salicylate-activating enzyme Irp5 is a promiscuous aryl acid adenylation enzyme capable of activating 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHBA) and driving the synthesis of catecholate-piscibactin/photoxenobactin and fluorinated analogs through precursor-directed biosynthesis. Our data support photoxenobactin E as the terminal product of the piscibactin/photoxenobactin pathway in <i>V. anguillarum</i>. Comparative genomics revealed frequent co-occurrence of <i>irp</i>-HPI with other siderophore systems, especially catecholate-type systems such as vanchrobactin. These findings provide new insight into the molecular basis of virulence in <i>Vibrionaceae</i> and highlight the ecological and evolutionary significance of siderophore system interplay, which may enhance metabolic diversity, promote environmental adaptability, and preserve virulence under mutational pressure. Iron acquisition is critical for bacterial survival and virulence, especially under the iron-limited conditions encountered in host environments. This study uncovers unexpected siderophore diversification within the piscibactin pathway, including two novel catecholate analogs and fluorinated derivatives produced via precursor-directed biosynthesis. We identify Irp5 as a versatile salicylate-activating enzyme that drives this metabolic flexibility. Moreover, the piscibactin and vanchrobactin systems interact at both biosynthetic and uptake levels, forming a resilient and adaptable iron acquisition network that supports virulence. These findings advance our understanding of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition and illustrate how enzymatic promiscuity and system interplay can be leveraged for synthetic biology and antimicrobial development.

40823826,Genomic diversity and adaptation in Arctic marine bacteria.,"Arctic marine bacteria experience seasonal changes in temperature, salinity, light, and sea ice cover. Time-series and metagenomic studies have identified spatiotemporal patterns in Arctic microbial communities, but a lack of complete genomes has limited efforts to identify the extent of genomic diversity in Arctic populations. We cultured and sequenced the complete genomes of 34 Arctic marine bacteria to identify patterns of gene gain, loss, and rearrangement that structure genomes and underlie adaptations to Arctic conditions. We found that the most abundant lineage in the Arctic (SAR11) is comprised of diverse species and subspecies, each encoding 50-150 unique genes. Half of the 16 SAR11 genomes harbor a genomic island with the potential to enhance survival in the Arctic by utilizing the osmoprotectant and potential methyl donor glycine betaine. We also cultured and sequenced four species representing an uncultured family of <i>Pseudomonadales</i>, four subspecies of <i>Pseudothioglobus</i> (SUP05), a genus of high GC <i>Puniceispirillales</i> (SAR116), and a family of low GC SAR116.

40862623,Comparative single-cell genomics of two uncultivated <i>Naegleria</i> species harboring <i>Legionella</i> cobionts.,"Amoeboflagellates of the genus <i>Naegleria</i> are free-living protists ubiquitously found in soil and freshwater habitats worldwide. They include the ""brain-eating amoeba"" <i>Naegleria fowleri</i>, an opportunistic pathogen that causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a rare but fatal infection of humans. Beyond their direct pathogenicity, protists can also act as environmental reservoirs for intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as <i>Legionella</i> spp., to persist and multiply in the environment. In this study, we carried out single-cell genome sequencing of two uncultivated <i>Naegleria</i> species isolated from the River Leam in England. From single cells, we generated two highly complete <i>Naegleria</i> genomes. Phylogenetic analyses placed these species as close relatives of <i>Naegleria fultoni</i> and <i>Naegleria pagei</i>. Exploring <i>Naegleria</i> evolutionary genomics, we identified gene families encoding antistasin-like domains, which have been characterized as factors that inhibit coagulation in blood-feeding leeches. Antistasin-like domains were identified in all sequenced <i>Naegleria</i> species and their close relative <i>Willaertia magna,</i> yet are otherwise largely restricted to animal genomes. Significantly, we recovered highly complete bacterial genomes from each <i>Naegleria</i> single-cell sample. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that both bacteria belong to the Legionellaceae family. Both bacterial genomes encode comprehensive sets of secretion systems and effector arsenals. We identified putative <i>Legionella</i> effectors that resemble TAL (Transcription activator-like) effectors from plant pathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp. in terms of protein sequence and predicted structure, representing a potentially novel class of <i>Legionella</i> effectors. Our study highlights the advantages of single-cell environmental genomics approaches, which enable direct association of intracellular pathogens with their hosts to better understand the evolution of host-pathogen interactions.IMPORTANCEBeyond their direct pathogenic potential, amoebae and other protists found in the environment can indirectly threaten human health by serving as reservoirs for intracellular bacterial pathogens to persist, evolve, and multiply in the environment. Despite their importance, protist-bacterial interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed single-cell genomics to sequence the genomes of two uncultivated <i>Naegleria</i> amoebae, both harboring novel <i>Legionella</i> bacteria. From individual cells, we recovered highly complete eukaryotic and bacterial cobiont genome assemblies.

40905696,Migration and standing variation in vaginal and rectal yeast populations in recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a very common human fungal infection. Most are successfully treated with antifungal drugs, yet ~8% lead to recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). Vaginal and rectal populations have been previously found to be closely related in RVVC. Yet the genomic methods used precluded the assessment of fine-scale relationships and the measurement of within-population variation, a fundamental property with evolutionary implications. To address this gap, we isolated 12 vaginal and 12 rectal yeast isolates from four individuals with a history of RVVC. Three individuals had <i>Candida albicans</i> infections<i>,</i> while the fourth had <i>Nakaseomyces glabratus</i>. All isolates were whole-genome sequenced and phenotyped. Isolates were placed into species-level phylogenies composed of isolates from many different countries and contexts, including an updated <i>N. glabratus</i> tree with over 500 isolates. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses were consistent with migration between sites. There was little phenotypic diversity in drug response and no consistent difference between isolates from different sites for invasive growth. Although there are few comparables, <i>C. albicans</i> nucleotide diversity was similar to most commensal oral and rectal populations, while <i>N. glabratus</i> was similar to some bloodstream infections (though higher than others). Single-nucleotide changes drove intra-population genetic differences; only a single loss-of-heterozygosity tract varied among isolates from within one participant. This study provides baseline measurements and describes techniques to quantify within-population diversity in fungal microbes. We highlight a need for comparable studies that use the same sampling effort and analysis methods to understand the interplay between evolutionary factors in shaping fungal microbial communities. Vaginal yeast infections are very common, yet we do not understand why some people experience chronic infections when most have a single infection that is successfully treated and cleared. We examined 12 vaginal and 12 rectal yeast isolates from four individuals with a history of recurrent yeast infections (total 96 isolates). Three participants had a <i>Candida albicans</i> infection (the most common causative species), while the fourth had a <i>Nakaseomyces glabratus</i> infection (the second most common and increasingly implicated).

40778765,Phenotypic and omics analyses of the Sordariomycetes <i>Marquandomyces marquandii</i> and <i>Albophoma yamanashiensis</i> isolated from estuarine sediments.,"Marine environments harbor a vast diversity of microorganisms, which have developed multiple strategies to adapt to challenging conditions and represent a valuable source for new products such as pigments, enzymes, and bioactive compounds. From all microorganisms inhabiting marine environments, fungi have been the least studied, despite their ubiquitous presence and great biotechnological potential. Here, we focused on the isolation and characterization of filamentous fungi from marine sediment samples, which were collected along the Basque coast in Spain. Through phenotypic characterization, we identified isolates potentially able to produce secondary metabolites or grow on minimal culture medium supplemented with recalcitrant algal polysaccharides. Based on this screening, two Sordariomycetes strains were selected for further analyses through genome sequencing and omics techniques: (i) a <i>Marquandomyces marquandii</i> strain (M60) able to stain the culture medium in yellow, indicative of secretion of pigments and secondary metabolites and (ii) an <i>Albophoma yamanashiensis</i> strain (M98) able to grow in minimal culture medium supplemented with the recalcitrant algal polysaccharide fucoidan. Fungal co-culture experiments suggested an inhibitory effect of the secretome of <i>M. marquandii</i> (strain M60) on fungal growth. Under culture conditions inducing pigment secretion, a set of secondary metabolite gene clusters was differentially expressed, as analyzed by RNA-seq. On the other hand, transcriptomic and proteomic experiments on <i>A. yamanashiensis</i> (strain M98) unveiled the enzymatic activities expressed in response to the presence of fucoidan. Overall, our results indicate that the isolated marine fungal strains could serve as a source of new enzymatic activities and secondary metabolites.IMPORTANCECharacterization of the mycobiota of marine and estuarine environments is important for the identification of new potential biotechnological products such as pigments, enzymes, and bioactive compounds. In this work, we describe the phenotypes and genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics features of the Sordariomycetes <i>Marquandomyces marquandii</i> (strain M60) and <i>Albophoma yamanashiensis</i> (strain M98). The former was selected as a pigment/secondary metabolite producer, and the secondary metabolite gene clusters differentially expressed under conditions inducing pigment production were identified. <i>A. yamanashiensis</i> (strain M98) was characterized as a potential degrader of fucoidan, and the carbohydrate-active enzymes and sulfatases induced in response to the presence of this sulfated, recalcitrant algal polysaccharide were identified.","Agirrezabala, Z; Otamendi, A; Liébana, R; Azkargorta, M; Perez-Cruz, C; Dueñas, M T; Ostra, M; López, R; Grigoriev, I V; Alonso-Sáez, L; Elortza, F; Lanzén, A; Haridas, S; Etxebeste, Oier","Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.; AZTI, Marine Research, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Sukarrieta, Spain.; AZTI, Marine Research, Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), Pasaia, Spain.; IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Spain.; Department of Applied Chemistry, Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, San Sebastián, Spain.; U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.; Proteomics Platform, Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE), Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), CIBERehd, Derio, Spain.; Department of Applied Chemistry, Laboratory of Microbiology, Faculty of Chemistry, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, San Sebastian, Spain.; Department of Organic Chemistry I, Faculty of Chemistry, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, San Sebastián, Spain.",mSystems,mSystems,,2025,08,08,2025,08,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40778765,10.1128/msystems.00625-25,40778765,0,,
40801505,"Antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic characterization of <i>Lactococcus formosensis</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, and <i>Lactococcus petauri</i> in Hong Kong.","Recent studies have shown that many isolates previously classified as <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i> were <i>L. petauri</i> and <i>L. formosensis</i>, complicating the understanding of the ecological niches, phylogeny, and phenotypic characteristics of these organisms. In this study, a total of 94 human feces and 166 food samples, collected from Hong Kong in 2021-2023, were cultured using selective media, with a positive rate of 21% for human feces, 37% for sashimi, 8% for cut fruits, and 8% for salad vegetables. The isolates (<i>n</i> = 67, including 43 from sashimi and four from ready-to-eat cut fruits and vegetables) from the cultured samples and additional human clinical isolates (<i>n</i> = 9) were further tested. Among the three species, the antimicrobial resistance profiles were similar, with resistance being extremely high for rifampicin (100%) and clindamycin (71%-92%), very high for cotrimoxazole (53%-58%), moderate to very high for minocycline (12%-56%) and low for levofloxacin (0%-2%). All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, ceftaroline, daptomycin, erythromycin, linezolid, meropenem, and vancomycin. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several distinct genomic clusters shared by the <i>L. petauri</i> isolates from both human and sashimi sources, while no such cross-sectoral clustering was observed for the other two species. The ability to ferment sucrose was linked to the presence of sucrose operons in the isolates, with all <i>L. petauri</i> and two <i>L. garvieae</i> isolates from Hong Kong exhibiting this trait. In conclusion, this work provides information on the resistance patterns of the three species and evidence of a link among <i>L. petauri</i> isolates from human and food sources. Recent studies have revealed evidence of human and animal host specificity among three closely related <i>Lactococcus</i> species: <i>L. formosensis</i>, <i>L. garvieae,</i> and <i>L. petauri</i>. Among the three species, <i>L. petauri</i> is the most frequent human pathogen. However, our understanding of the presence of these three species in food samples, which could be potential sources of human infection, remains limited. It is also not clear whether these species display varying susceptibilities to commonly used antibiotics for treating human infection. This study found the frequent contamination of sashimi (37%) with <i>L. petauri</i>. Genomic investigation revealed cross-sectoral phylogenetic clustering of some <i>L. petauri</i> isolates from sashimi and human sources, indicating a potential mode of human transmission through contaminated sashimi. No cross-sectoral clustering of isolates was observed for the other two species.

40879375,Genomics insight on passion fruit viral disease complexity.,"Passion fruit viral diseases pose a significant threat to Kenya's passion fruit industry. To unravel the complexity of these diseases, comprehensive virus surveys were conducted across major passion fruit-growing counties. Passion fruit woodiness disease symptoms, like fruit hardening, chlorotic mottling, and leaf distortion, were prevalent. The study unveiled the first 23 complete genomes of Ugandan passiflora virus (UPV) and two East Asian passiflora distortion virus (EAPDV) in Kenya. UPV showed 99% nucleotide (nt) match to a UPV genome from Uganda and 66% nt identity match to EAPDV. In addition, UPV variants and two partial passion fruit green spot virus sequences and partial (passiflora emaravirus) segment RNA1-5 (novel allexivirus and an emaravirus, respectively) were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct lineages (I-III), indicating potential multiple introductions into Kenya. Recombination analysis detected no significant breakpoints. However, the study proposed the renaming of EAPDV to passiflora distortion virus (PDV) and UPV to passiflora virus (PV) for neutral nomenclature, without geographical association. Additionally, the study highlighted the role of coinfections in symptom expression, suggesting a potential synergistic relationship between PV, PDV, and other viruses. The results recommend stringent management strategies and enhanced surveillance to mitigate the economic impact of these viruses on the Kenyan passion fruit industry. The findings from this study underscore the need to strengthen nursery certification programs and pest diagnostic protocols in Kenya. Additionally, enhanced pest surveillance and import regulations are critical to preventing the introduction and spread of emerging plant viral diseases, thereby safeguarding the country's horticultural productivity and biosecurity. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viral diseases of passion fruit in Kenya.IMPORTANCEThis study presents the first comprehensive survey of viral pathogens affecting passion fruit in Kenya, identifying Ugandan passiflora virus (UPV) and East Asian passiflora distortion virus (EAPDV) as major contributors.

Phylogenetic analysis identified distinct lineages, suggesting possible multiple viral introductions in Kenya. The study also highlights potential synergistic coinfections between UPV, EAPDV, and other viruses, leading to more severe disease symptoms. In light of these findings, the study proposes renaming EAPDV as passiflora distortion virus and UPV as passiflora virus for a more neutral name classification.

40838747,Unraveling the ecological success of <i>Iodidimonas</i> in a bioreactor treating oil and gas produced water.,"<i>Iodidimonas</i> sp., a bacterium found in bioreactors treating oil and gas produced water as well as iodide-rich brines, has garnered attention for its unique ability to oxidize iodine. However, little is known about the metabolic capabilities that enable <i>Iodidimonas</i> sp. to thrive in certain unique ecological niches. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and sequenced three strains belonging to the <i>Iodidimonas</i> genus from the sludge of a membrane bioreactor used for produced water treatment. We investigated the genomic features of these isolates and compared them with the four publicly available isolate genomes from this genus, as well as a metagenome-assembled genome from the source bioreactor. Our <i>Iodidimonas</i> isolates had several genes associated with mitigating salinity, heavy metal, and organic compound stress, which likely help these bacteria to survive in produced water. Phenotyping tests revealed that while the isolates could utilize a wide variety of simple carbon substrates, they failed to degrade aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, consistent with the lack of genes associated with common hydrocarbon degradation pathways in their genomes. We hypothesize that these microbes may lead a scavenging lifestyle in the bioreactor and similar iodide-rich brines. Occupying a niche habitat and having few representative isolates, the genus <i>Iodidimonas</i> is a relatively understudied alphaproteobacterial group. Its ability to corrode pipes in iodine production facilities has economic implications, and its ability to generate potentially carcinogenic iodinated organic compounds during treatment of oil and gas produced water may cause environmental and health concerns with the recycling of treated water. Therefore, detailed characterization of the metabolic potential of the <i>Iodidimonas</i> isolates in this study both sheds light on their adaptation to the environmental conditions they inhabit and has environmental and economic significance.","Acharya, Shwetha M; Yang, Yuguo; Enalls, Brandon C; Walian, Peter J; Van Houghton, Brett D; Rosenblum, James S; Cath, Tzahi Y; Tringe, Susannah G; Chakraborty, Romy","Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.; Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.; US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.; Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA.; Department of Ecology, Earth and Environmental Sciences Area, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,08,21,2025,08,21,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40838747,10.1128/spectrum.00683-25,40838747,0,0,NONE
40815159,The impact of bioinformatic choices on <i>Coccidioides</i> variant identification accuracy.,"Emerging fungal pathogens, such as <i>Coccidioides</i>, the causative agent of Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, pose significant clinical and public health challenges. While advances in genomic epidemiology have enhanced our understanding of <i>Coccidioides</i> evolutionary history, effective variant identification is complicated by the genome's structural complexity. Repetitive elements, transposable sequences, and regions of low complexity can lead to incorrect variant calls, affecting downstream analyses. Further, accurate species identification is essential for understanding the spread of <i>C. immitis</i> and <i>C. posadasii</i>, which, despite having distinct primary geographic distributions, can co-occur. Distinguishing between these species is critical for interpreting patterns of transmission, emergence, and potential shifts in endemicity. To address this, we developed a pipeline to identify genetic variants and assign species directly from sequencing reads. We evaluated the performance of variant identification both across the genome and after excluding repetitive regions identified by NUCmer, a commonly used tool, on simulated genomic data and empirically generated sequence data. Whole-genome calling detected the highest number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), over 80,000 on average in both species, but included a substantial number of false positives, with 42,834 true positives and 38,115 false positives identified. Masking repetitive regions significantly enhanced accuracy. In <i>C. immitis</i>, masking with NUCmer increased sensitivity from 70.1% to 91.7% and precision from 52.7% to 91.1%. Similarly, in <i>C. posadasii</i>, sensitivity improved from 80.0% to 96.1% and precision from 53.1% to 90.4%. These improvements were also reflected in overall F1 scores, which rose from 60%-64% in whole-genome analysis to over 90% after masking. Using simulated reads, our pipeline recovered 83,400 SNPs in <i>C. posadasii</i>, with 40,163 shared across regions and a Jaccard index of 0.36. Species classification was highly accurate-100% in simulations and 98.9% in 175 publicly available samples. Here, we provide a benchmarked variant and species identification pipeline for <i>Coccidioides</i> and quantify the impact of genomic region on variant identification performance, which may have downstream impacts on phylogenetic and genomic epidemiology inference.IMPORTANCEAccurate genetic analysis is essential for tracking and understanding emerging fungal pathogens like <i>Coccidioides</i>, the cause of Valley fever. However, the complex structure of fungal genomes makes it difficult to identify genetic differences reliably. This study demonstrates that the choice of genomic regions has a substantial impact on variant detection accuracy. We developed and tested a new tool called <i>cocci-call</i> and found that focusing on specific regions of the genome dramatically improves the accuracy of genetic variant detection. This improvement could enhance how researchers monitor outbreaks, track fungal evolution, and design better diagnostics. By identifying high-confidence regions for analysis, our work helps standardize how <i>Coccidioides</i> genomes are studied and compared, laying the groundwork for more accurate and reproducible genomic research in this important pathogen.","Marchetti, Marco; Fonseca, Emanuel M; Hanson, Kimberly E; Barker, Bridget; Walter, Katharine S","Division of Epidemiology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Pathology, Division of Clinical Microbiology, University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA.; Elfa Analytics, Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais, Brazil.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.; Eccles Institute of Human Genetics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,08,15,2025,08,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40815159,10.1128/spectrum.01232-25,40815159,0,,
40853149,Single-cell RNA sequencing defines developmental progression and reproductive transitions of <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>.,"<i>Pneumocystis</i> species are host-obligate fungal pathogens that cause severe pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals. Despite their clinical importance, their life cycle remains poorly understood, in part because <i>Pneumocystis</i> depends on the host environment for most nutrients and requires sexual reproduction for survival, which occurs exclusively <i>in vivo</i>. This study presents the first single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i>, generated from isolated organisms recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of infected rats to map the life cycle of <i>P. carinii</i>. Transcriptomes from 87,716 cells were analyzed using the 10× Genomics platform, revealing 13 transcriptionally distinct clusters representing key developmental stages, including biosynthetically active trophic forms, mating-competent intermediates, and asci undergoing sporulation. These states were characterized by expression of MAPK signaling components, β-glucan-modifying enzymes, and spore-associated genes, respectively. The scRNA-seq data support previous evidence that these host-obligate fungi undergo sexual reproduction and provide new insights into the gene expression patterns associated with different life cycle phases. Biomarkers associated with ascus formation identified by scRNA-seq were validated by RT-qPCR, showing decreased expression levels in ascus-depleted populations treated with anidulafungin, a drug that halts ascus formation. More broadly, this approach provides a strategy for studying the full life cycles of fungal pathogens that cannot be continuously cultured. <i>Pneumocystis</i> species (spp.) are clinically significant fungal pathogens that cannot be sustainably cultured <i>in vitro</i> due to their host-obligate nature. This longstanding limitation has impeded progress in understanding their life cycle and identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we apply scRNA-seq to <i>P. carinii</i> isolated directly from infected rat lungs, generating the first transcriptional map of its developmental progression. Our results define discrete gene expression states associated with trophic growth, mating activation, and ascus formation and provide transcriptional evidence for a structured life cycle, clarifying key developmental transitions and identifying potential regulatory targets for therapeutic intervention. Importantly, this study demonstrates that scRNA-seq can resolve the developmental biology of host-restricted fungal pathogens that cannot be cultured <i>in vitro</i>. This approach offers a generalizable framework for investigating other unculturable or obligate microbial pathogens directly within their native host environments, where traditional experimental tools are limited.","Albee, Aaron W; Sayson, Steven G; Ashbaugh, Alan; Wolf, Nicholas J; Porollo, Aleksey; Smulian, George; Cushion, Melanie T","Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; The Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,08,25,2025,09,04,I01 BX004441_BX_BLRD VA_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40853149,10.1128/spectrum.01277-25,40853149,0,0,NONE
40827881,HPVPool-Seq: a genotype-guided pooling strategy for cost-effective next-generation sequencing detection of HPV integration in cervical samples.,"Integration of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA is a critical event in carcinogenesis and a promising biomarker for risk stratification. However, the high cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) limits its widespread clinical adoption. We developed HPVPool-Seq, an innovative pooling strategy that leverages the inherent diversity of HPV genotypes as natural barcodes, enabling cost-effective, scalable integration detection. Samples were pooled based on qPCR-derived HPV genotypes and viral loads prior to targeted NGS and bioinformatic decoding. A web-based automation tool was implemented to streamline pooling and decoding workflows. In a proof-of-concept study of 175 clinical specimens, HPVPool-Seq achieved 77.1% exact genotype concordance and 97.1% combined sensitivity compared with qPCR. Cost simulations demonstrated a 60% reduction in per-sample sequencing expenses. Self-correcting capability through targeted retesting further enhanced reliability. HPVPool-Seq offers a novel, traceable, and economically viable solution for high-throughput HPV integration profiling, balancing cost, scalability, and clinical precision. This strategy sets a new framework for molecular screening in HPV-associated cancers. Accurate detection of high-risk HPV integration is critical for identifying individuals at true risk of progression to malignancy. However, the high cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has limited its widespread clinical application. Here, we propose HPVPool-Seq, a novel pooling-based sequencing strategy that uses HPV genotypes as intrinsic barcodes to guide sample pooling without compromising detection sensitivity. This method dramatically reduces sequencing costs while maintaining genotype-level traceability and offers a built-in mechanism for selective retesting of discordant cases. By addressing both technical and economic barriers, our approach provides a scalable, clinically applicable solution for HPV integration profiling in large cohorts, with important implications for precision screening, triage, and epidemiological surveillance.","Guan, Wenyan; Liu, Siyuan; Chen, Yiqiang; Chu, Chengzhuo; Peng, Guanghao; Wang, Jinhuan; Weng, Qiao; Fu, Yali; Li, Jingjing","Department of Precision Medical Center, Nanjing Normal University Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Jiangsu Health Development Research Center, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Pathology, Women's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Contraceptives Vigilance and Fertility Surveillance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Laboratory of Fertility Protection and Health Technology Assessment, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Pathology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Precision Medical Center, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,08,19,2025,08,19,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827881,10.1128/spectrum.01399-25,40827881,0,,
40919784,Hidden diversity in <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> revealed by CRISPR2 screening: eco-evolutionary insights into a novel subspecies.,"<i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the gut of humans and animals and is a major opportunistic pathogen, known for causing multidrug-resistant healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Its ability to thrive in diverse environments and disseminate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) across ecological niches highlights the importance of understanding its ecological, evolutionary, and epidemiological dynamics. The CRISPR2 locus has been used as a valuable marker for assessing clonality and phylogenetic relationships in <i>E. faecalis</i>. In this study, we identified a group of <i>E. faecalis</i> strains lacking CRISPR2, forming a distinct, well-supported clade. We demonstrate that this clade meets the genomic criteria for classification as a novel subspecies, here referred to as ""subspecies B."" Through a comprehensive pangenome analysis and comparative genomics, we explored the adaptive ecological traits underlying this diversification process, identifying clade-specific features and their predicted functional roles. Our findings suggest that the frequent isolation of subspecies B from meat products and processing facilities may reflect dissemination routes involving environmental contamination (e.g., water, plants, soil) from avian species. The absence of key virulence traits required for pathogenicity in mammals, particularly humans, and the lack of clinically relevant resistance determinants indicate that subspecies B currently poses minimal threat to public health compared with the broadly disseminated ""subspecies A."" Nevertheless, the unclear potential for genetic exchange between these subspecies and the frequent association of subspecies B with food sources calls for continued genomic surveillance of <i>E. faecalis</i> from a One Health perspective to detect and mitigate the emergence of high-risk variants in advance.IMPORTANCEExploring intraspecific genetic variability in generalist bacteria with pathogenic potential, such as <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, is a key to uncovering stable evolutionary trends. By screening the CRISPR2 locus across a representative set of genomes from diverse sources, this study reveals a previously unrecognized lineage within the population structure of <i>E. faecalis</i>, associated with underexplored nonhuman and nonhospital reservoirs. These findings broaden our knowledge of the species' genetic landscape and shed light on its adaptive strategies and patterns of ecological dissemination. By bridging phylogenetic patterns with variation in genetic defense systems and accessory traits, the study generates testable hypotheses about the genomic determinants and corresponding selective pressures that shape the species' behavior and long-term dissemination. This work offers new perspectives on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>E. faecalis</i> and highlights the value of genomic surveillance beyond clinical settings, in alignment with One Health principles.","Leite, Vitor Luis Macena; Faria, Adriana Rocha; Guerra, Clara Ferreira; Souza, Stephanie da Silva Rodrigues; Freitas, Andréa de Andrade Rangel; Morais, Jaqueline Martins; Merquior, Vânia Lúcia Carreira; Planet, Paul J; Teixeira, Lúcia Martins","Institute for Comparative Genomics, American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Biological Sciences, University at Albany, State University of New York, Albany, New York, USA.; Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Pediatric Infectious Disease Division, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Góes, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.; Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40919784,10.1128/spectrum.01428-25,40919784,0,0,NONE
40920009,Ultra-high field strength electroporation enables efficient DNA transformation and genome editing in nontuberculous mycobacteria.,"Efficient DNA delivery is essential for genetic manipulation of mycobacteria and for dissecting their physiology, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. Although electroporation enables transformation efficiencies exceeding 10⁵ CFU per µg DNA in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, it remains highly inefficient in many nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i>. Here, we discovered that NTM such as <i>M. abscessus</i> exhibit exceptional tolerance to ultra-high electric field strengths and that hypertonic preconditioning partially protects cells from electroporation-induced damage. Using ultra-high electric field strength (3 kV/mm) electroporation, we achieved dramatic improvements in plasmid transformation efficiency-up to 106-fold in <i>M. abscessus</i>, 83-fold in <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, and 37-fold in <i>Mycobacterium kansasii</i>-compared to standard conditions (1.25  kV/mm). Transformation efficiency was further influenced by the choice of selectable marker. Ultra-high field strength electroporation also markedly enhanced allelic exchange in <i>M. abscessus</i> expressing Che9c RecET recombinases, increasing the recovery of gene deletion mutants by over 1,000-fold relative to conventional electroporation. In parallel, oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering for targeted point mutations produced nearly 10,000-fold more mutants under ultra-high field conditions. Together, these findings establish ultra-high field electroporation as a robust, broadly applicable platform for genetic engineering of NTMs. This method substantially enhances transformation efficiency and enables construction of advanced genetic tools-including expression libraries and CRISPRi knockdown libraries-in species that have historically resisted genetic manipulation.IMPORTANCEInfections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), including <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i>, are increasing globally, yet genetic manipulation of these pathogens remains technically challenging due to inefficient DNA delivery and low gene editing success. The ultra-high electric field strength electroporation strategy described here overcomes these barriers, enabling dramatic improvements in both transformation and genome editing efficiency. This advance paves the way for high-throughput functional genomics in NTMs, including the construction of genome-wide knockout, CRISPRi knockdown, and expression libraries. Broad adoption of this approach will accelerate discovery of genetic determinants of virulence and drug resistance, facilitating the development of antimicrobials and vaccines.","Tang, Daoyan; Wang, Minggui; Wang, Dan; Yang, Danni; Cai, Yi; Luo, Tao; He, Jianqing; Wang, Qinglan","Department of Pathogen Biology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences & Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Infection Immunity and Inflammation, Department of Pathogen Biology, Shenzhen University Medical School, Shenzhen, China.; State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Health and Multimorbidity, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Institute of Respiratory Health, Frontiers Science Center for Disease-related Molecular Network, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40920009,10.1128/spectrum.01944-25,40920009,0,0,NONE

WGS-based genomic surveillance provides information on the genetic diversity and tracks the evolution of important viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Multiplex tiling polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been used to facilitate sequencing of a variety of pathogens in support of genomics-based surveillance initiatives. We developed, optimized, and implemented multiplex tiling PCR assays for RSVA and RSVB capable of generating near-complete genomes in the majority of contemporaneous specimens tested.

Overall, the RSV phylogenetic tree built with whole genomes showed identical lineage clusters as compared to the <i>G</i> gene but was more discriminatory. Moreover, the availability of complete genomes enables the identification of a broader range of mutations. For instance, mutations identified in the fusion protein among Canadian isolates tested here, including S377N, K272M, S276N, S211N, S206I, and S209Q, could affect the efficacy of current vaccines or antiviral-based therapeutics. In conclusion, our work reinforces other recent studies demonstrating the utility of multiplex tiling PCR assays to facilitate high-throughput WGS of RSV, which is capable of supporting enhanced genomic surveillance initiatives, as well as the more comprehensive genomic analyses required to inform public health strategies for the development and usage of vaccines and antiviral drugs. We present assays to efficiently sequence genomes of RSVA and RSVB. This enables researchers and public health agencies to acquire high-quality genomic data using rapid and cost-effective approaches. Genomic data-based comparative analysis can be used to conduct surveillance and monitor circulating isolates for efficacy of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics.","Gao, Ruimin; Buchanan, Cody; Dust, Kerry; Van Caeseele, Paul; Wong, Henry; Sjaarda, Calvin; Sheth, Prameet M; Jassem, Agatha N; Minion, Jessica; Bastien, Nathalie","British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, Provincial Health Services Authority, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.; Kingston Health Sciences Centre and Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.; Laboratory Medicine, Saskatchewan Health Authority, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.; Virus Detection, Cadham Provincial Laboratory, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.; National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.",Microbiology spectrum,Microbiol Spectr,,2025,09,03,2025,09,03,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40899818,10.1128/spectrum.03142-24,40899818,0,0,NONE

Our group includes genetic counsellors under this diverse category of healthcare workers.This group came together as part of the National Institute for Health and Social Care Research (NIHR) Genomics Research National Specialty Group. After responding to a survey to elicit the views of NMAHPs working in genomics, some of the original 45 respondents, along with others who learnt of the project by word of mouth, have worked together to produce this article. The paper aims to set out in clear terms the value of NMAHPs to research that supports the patient-centred implementation of genomics in the National Health Service (NHS). We discuss four potential areas where NMAHPs, in particular, can contribute to the research. These are patient perspectives and epistemic justice, psychosocial impacts, the familial nature of genomics and equity. We argue that this group (NMAHPs) represents a potentially underused resource for the NHS as it seeks to ensure that advances in genomics are translated into patient benefit. We propose that NMAHPs, with our research expertise, are well placed to shape and deliver a research agenda that explores models of patient-centred care in the genomics era. We call for increased funding for NMAHP research roles and funding opportunities to deliver this fundamental work.","Cowley, Lorraine; Henriques, Sasha; Roberts, J; Monje-Garcia, Laura; Nolan, J; Lubasch, K; Theobald, R; Greer, R; Fennell, N; Clarkson, A; Clapham, M; Chilton, S; Allon, R; Stopford, Cheryl; Pierce, Heather Hanson; Holliday, D","Engagement and Society, Wellcome Connecting Science, Hinxton, UK.; North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust, Penrith, Cumbria, UK.; University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.; Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.; The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.; Faculty of Education, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK sasha.henriques@wellcomeconnectingscience.org.; East Suffolk and North Essex NHS foundation Trust, Colchester, UK.; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.; Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.; Northern Genetics Service, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.; St Mark's Centre for Familial Intestinal Cancer, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, Harrow, London, UK.",BMJ open,BMJ Open,"Humans, Genomics, Allied Health Personnel, United Kingdom, Midwifery, Patient-Centered Care, State Medicine, Nurses",2025,08,12,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40803726,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-086962,40803726,0,,

Additionally, the study analysed developmental phenotypic trajectories and their associated paediatric diseases. Infants registered or residing in Kunshan and Qidong, Jiangsu Province, who participated in the Chinese Child Healthcare Programme (0-6 years) were enrolled. The baseline population was stratified into enhanced and basic cohorts. General characteristics, periconceptional and perinatal information and health check-up data were collected from each participant. Dual screening (urinary ultrasound and urine dipstick tests) was conducted during scheduled check-ups. Structured CKD questionnaires were administered, and biosamples (urine and dried blood spots) were obtained for the long-term storage and analysis using standard procedures. Based on the proposed referral procedure, participants with abnormal results were referred for further diagnosis and evaluation. The KQBC enrolled 10 127 infants (5392 boys and 4735 girls) with a mean age of 2.11±1.68 months. Urinary system ultrasound and urine dipstick screening showed positivity rates of 8.9% (900/10 083) and 6.5% (532/8233), respectively. Baseline ultrasound screening facilitated timely surgical intervention in six children. Among the 7965 respondents, only 13% demonstrated awareness of paediatric CKD. Additionally, 7273 dried blood spots and 7990 urine specimens were collected and stored. A paediatric CKD screening platform was developed. According to our plan, the KQBC will be followed up for 3-6 years to investigate the incidence, aetiology and risk factors of early onset CKD. In-depth developmental phenotypes, such as urinary multiomics and ultrasound imaging, should be studied for longitudinal paediatric kidney health. We aim to develop multimodal risk prediction models by integrating genomics and artificial intelligence algorithms. The KQBC also enables prospective cohort studies addressing extensive research questions.

40784761,TRIAGE-GS: protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a genomics-first approach to rare disease diagnosis for patients awaiting assessment by a clinical geneticist.,"Rare diseases (RD) are collectively common and often genetic. Families value and can benefit from precise molecular diagnoses. Prolonged diagnostic odysseys exacerbate the burden of RD on patients, families and the healthcare system. Genome sequencing (GS) is a near-comprehensive test for genetic RD, but existing care models-where consultation with a medical geneticist is a prerequisite for testing-predate GS and may limit access or delay diagnosis. Evidence is needed to guide the optimal positioning of GS in care pathways. While initiating GS prior to geneticist consultation has been trialled in acute care settings, there are no data to inform the utility of this approach in outpatient care, where most patients with RD seek genetics services. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic yield, time to diagnosis, clinical and personal utility and incremental cost-effectiveness of GS initiated at the time of referral triage (pre-geneticist evaluation) compared with standard of care. 200 paediatric patients referred to one of two large genetics centres in Ontario, Canada, for suspected genetic RD will be randomised into a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (GS first) or standard of care (geneticist first) arm. An unblinded, permuted block randomisation design will be used, stratified within each recruitment site by phenotype and prior genetic testing. The primary outcome measure is time to genetic diagnosis or to cessation of active follow-up. Survival analysis will be used to analyse time-to-event data. Additional measures will include patient-reported and family-reported measures of satisfaction, understanding and perceived test utility, clinician-reported measures of perceived test utility and management impact, and healthcare system utilisation and costs. This study was approved by Clinical Trials Ontario. Results will be disseminated, at minimum, via peer-reviewed journals, professional conferences and internal reports to funding bodies. Efforts will be made to share aggregated study results with participants and their families.

Primary care presents an ideal environment to offer equitable and efficient access to genetic services. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a preventable and treatable cause of premature heart disease and represents a health condition that can be successfully diagnosed and managed in primary care. This study describes a process for tailoring a primary-tertiary shared care model for FH to optimise health professional and patient engagement. Data were collected through semistructured interviews (n=10) with stakeholders in New South Wales, Australia. Interviews gathered feedback on how to tailor a shared care model for FH between tertiary and primary care services. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse interview transcripts. Analysis generated three main themes: (1) current process for genetic testing and management, (2) challenges with genetic testing for FH in primary care and (3) components needed to enable a tertiary-initiated shared care model. Participants considered the model of care acceptable and could be successfully implemented, provided key supports were in place to assist general practitioners. Based on these results, a process model for integrating genetic testing for other conditions into primary care settings was developed, using FH as an exemplar. The process model for tailoring of a primary-tertiary model of care for FH can be applied across a range of primary care services and treatable genetic conditions.","Birkenhead, Karen L; Sullivan, David; Calder, Madeline; Spinks, Catherine; Fleming, Gabrielle; Trumble, Claire; Hemmert, Cameron; Trent, Ronald; Srinivasan, Shubha; Martin, Kerrie; Carr, Bridie; Hespe, Charlotte M; Sarkies, Mitchell","School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Clinical Genetics Network and Ophthalmology Network, Agency for Clinical Innovation, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia karen.birkenhead@sydney.edu.au.; Department of Medical Genomics, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Implementation Science Academy, Sydney Health Partners, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; School of Medicine, University of Notre Dame Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Discipline of Child and Adolescent Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Chemical Pathology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Institute of Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics, Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Central Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Cardiac Network, Agency for Clinical Innovation, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.",Family medicine and community health,Fam Med Community Health,"Humans, Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II, Primary Health Care, Genetic Testing, New South Wales, Interviews as Topic, Tertiary Healthcare, Female, Qualitative Research, Male",2025,08,14,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40813103,10.1136/fmch-2024-003258,40813103,0,,
40907998,The spontaneous neoantigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to a growing tumor is functionally and phenotypically diverse.,"CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in the positive and negative regulation of cellular immunity through the many functional subsets they comprise. The progressive growth of immunogenic tumors which nonetheless generate mutation-specific T cells suggests that effective immune control may be avoided or suppressed at the level of the neoantigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response. Despite their importance, little is known about the ontogeny, architecture, and development of the CD4<sup>+</sup> NeoAg-specific repertoire induced by progressively growing tumor. We used a tetramer specific for a validated neoantigen, CTLC<sub>H129>Q</sub>/I-A<sup>k</sup>, to characterize the ontogeny of natural CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to an aggressive and poorly immunogenic major histocompatibility complex class II-deficient tumor, squamous cell carcinoma VII (SCC VII), during progressive growth or following therapeutic peptide vaccination using a combination of flow cytometry, single-cell genomics, and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene engineering. We find that the natural CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to a growing tumor is phenotypically and functionally diverse, with distinct subsets including type 1 helper, T follicular helper-like, and regulatory T cell (Treg) lineages appearing as early as 9 days after tumor implantation. Therapeutic vaccination using the CLTC<sub>H129>Q</sub> peptide in adjuvant plus α-programmed cell death protein-1 reduces the frequency of CLTC<sub>H129>Q</sub>-specific Treg in both tumor and tumor-draining lymph node. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of CLTC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells recapitulated and extended the diversity of the response, with TCRs of varying affinity found within each functional subset. The TCR affinity differences did not strictly correlate with function, however, as even the lowest affinity TCRs isolated from Treg can mediate therapeutic efficacy against established tumors in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT). These findings offer unprecedented insight into the functional diversity of a natural neoantigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response and show how immunotherapeutic intervention influences the phenotype, magnitude, and efficacy of the antitumor immune response. This information could lead to new approaches to immune monitoring in the clinical setting of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and cancer vaccines. Furthermore, we show that Treg can be a potent source of TCRs that can mediate therapeutic benefit in the setting of ACT.","Griswold, Ryan Q; Brightman, Spencer E; Soria Zavala, Karla; Ordaz-Arias, Manuel Azaid; Djassemi, Navid; Thota, Rukman R; Naradikian, Martin S; Dose, Hannah; Alarcon, Suzie; Vijayanand, Pandurangan; Peters, Bjoern; Miller, Aaron M; Cohen, Ezra E W; Schoenberger, Stephen P","AUGenomics Pty Ltd, San Diego, California, USA.; Division of Hematology and Oncology, UC San Diego Health Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA.; University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.; La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA.; Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, California, USA sps@lji.org.",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,J Immunother Cancer,"CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Antigens, Neoplasm, Animals, Mice, Humans, Phenotype",2025,09,04,2025,09,10,U01 DE028227_DE_NIDCR NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40907998,10.1136/jitc-2025-012209,40907998,0,0,NONE

40917822,Improved Etiological Diagnosis of Nonresolving or Slowly Resolving Pneumonia Through Combined Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy and Metagenomic Sequencing.,"<b>Background:</b> Nonresolving or slowly resolving pneumonia (NRP) poses a diagnostic challenge because infectious and noninfectious etiologies often mimic community-acquired pneumonia on imaging. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (EBUS-TBLB) improves tissue acquisition for peripheral lesions, whereas metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers culture-independent pathogen detection. Whether their combination enhances etiological clarification of NRP remains uncertain. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 109 consecutive adults with NRP unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy were randomized to EBUS-TBLB alone (<i>n</i> = 66) or EBUS-TBLB + mNGS (<i>n</i> = 43). Baseline characteristics, diagnostic yield, and procedure-related complications were recorded. Diagnostic positivity, sensitivity for infectious agents, and safety profiles were compared using <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact tests, with <i>p</i> < 0.05 considered significant. <b>Results:</b> Overall diagnostic yield increased from 50.0% with EBUS-TBLB to 72.1% with the combined approach (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup> = 4.37, <i>p</i> < 0.05). mNGS significantly improved detection of bacterial/fungal pneumonia (0% vs. 13.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and pulmonary <i>tuberculosis</i> (0% vs. 20.9%; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Malignancy remained the predominant diagnosis (57.8% of all cases); yields for most tumor subtypes were comparable between groups. Complication rates did not differ between the two groups: minor bleeding (19.7% vs. 23.3%), hypoxia (50.0% vs. 48.8%), pneumothorax (4.5% vs. 0%), and delayed recovery (4.5% vs. 7.0%) (<i>p</i> > 0.05). No severe adverse events occurred. <b>Conclusions:</b> EBUS-TBLB + mNGS represents a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of complex respiratory cases, integrating imaging with advanced genomics to enhance precision medicine. In practice, early implementation of the EBUS-TBLB + mNGS diagnostic protocol in patients with NRP can help exclude malignancy or confirm an infectious etiology.","Li, Qiang; Jian, Li; Zhao, Qiquan","Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Dazu's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.; Department of Endocrinology, The Affiliated Dazu's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.",Canadian respiratory journal,Can Respir J,"Humans, Male, Female, Middle Aged, Aged, Pneumonia, Metagenomics, Bronchoscopy, Image-Guided Biopsy, Adult, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Pneumonia, Bacterial",2025,08,28,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40917822,10.1155/carj/7651699,40917822,0,0,NONE

Gene sequencing, three-dimensional structural reconstruction of protein sequences, and in vitro mRNA splicing experiments were performed. <b>Results:</b> The proband and his sister exhibited developmental delays, seizures, yellow hair, sparse teeth and a high forehead. Furthermore, the sister initially presented with intractable diarrhoea and severe pneumonia. Both siblings showed varying degrees of developmental delays during follow-up, and the proband also showed symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The microscopic hair examination revealed a deficiency in intermediate pigment, a pale colour and an intermittent or absent medulla. Genetic sequencing revealed a homozygous <i>AP1S1</i> mutation at the splicing site (NM_001283.3): c.430-1G>A. The in vitro mRNA splicing experiments confirmed a single base-pair deletion in the fifth exon of the mRNA sequence of the mutated plasmid, resulting in a frameshift mutation (p.Glu144ArgfsTer83). The mutation was inherited from both parents and classified as pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, based on clinical features and family analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> Both children with MEDNIK syndrome exhibited heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Sparse teeth may be a previously unnoticed feature of MEDNIK syndrome. The pathogenic c.430-1G>A homozygous variant enriches the mutation spectrum of <i>AP1S1</i>. This mutation causes a frameshift mutation in the protein, altering the protein structure and affecting protein function.","Duan, Lifen; Shen, Ru; Yin, Guoyan; Tao, Ruixi; Zhang, Yi; Yu, Wei; Bao, Lishimeng; Ye, Weitao; Yin, Runxiu; Tian, Xin","Epilepsy Center, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, China.; Division of Laboratory, Kunming Maternity and Child Care Hospital, Kunming, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.; Epilepsy Center, The Affiliated Children's Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Children's Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.; Department of Hematology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, China.",International journal of genomics,Int J Genomics,,2025,08,25,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40901618,10.1155/ijog/4385128,40901618,0,0,NONE
40905821,Homologous recombination deficiency and survival in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma by self-reported race.,"Half of ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) have homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). However, HRD is not well-characterized in Black individuals who experience worse survival after a diagnosis of HGSC. The objective of this study was to characterize ovarian HGSC HRD and examine its association with survival by self-reported race. HRD features were identified using matched tumor-normal whole-exome and RNA sequencing in a HGSC cohort. We calculated age and stage-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival, comparing individuals with a feature to those without, separately by self-reported race. Any HRD was associated with a 32% reduced risk of death in Black individuals compared with a 62% reduction in White individuals (Black HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.43-1.09; White HR=0.38, 95%CI 0.14-1.04). More of the germline and somatic variants detected among Black individuals were unannotated or variants of uncertain significance (VUS; germline 65% versus 45%; somatic 62% versus 50%, respectively). Black individuals with germline unannotated/VUS were more likely to have tumors with HRD scarring and a first-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer compared with those without (HRD scar 71.4% versus 49.6%; family history 68.4% versus 34.6%). HRD testing informs precision-based medicine approaches that improve outcomes, but a higher proportion of VUS among Black individuals may complicate referral for such care leading to worse outcomes for Black individuals. Our findings emphasize the importance of recruiting diverse individuals in genomics research and better characterizing VUS.","Lawson-Michod, Katherine A; Johnson, Courtney E; Barnard, Mollie E; Davidson, Natalie R; Collin, Lindsay J; Nix, David A; Huff, Chad D; Berchuck, Andrew; Salas, Lucas A; Greene, Casey S; Marks, Jeffrey R; Peres, Lauren C; Doherty, Jennifer A; Schildkraut, Joellen M","The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, United States.; Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, United States.; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA, United States.; Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver, CO, United States.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.; Huntsman Cancer Institute, United States.; Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.; Boston University, Boston, MA, United States.; Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States.; Duke Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,,2025,09,04,2025,09,09,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40905821,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-0762,40905821,0,0,NONE
40900635,Cancer genomic alterations and microenvironmental features encode synergistic interactions with disease outcomes.,"Oncogenesis, tumor progression and therapy response are shaped by somatic alterations in the cancer genome and features of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). How interactions between these two systems influence tumor evolution and clinical outcomes remains incompletely understood. To address this challenge, we developed the multi-omics analysis framework PACIFIC that systematically integrates genetic cancer drivers and infiltration profiles of immune cells to find pairwise combinations of drivers and TME characteristics that jointly associate with clinical outcomes. By analyzing 8500 primary tumor samples of 26 cancer types, we report 34 immunogenomic interactions (IGXs) in 13 cancer types in which context-specific combinations of genomic alterations and immune cell levels were significantly correlated with patient survival. Subsets of tumor samples defined by some IGXs were characterized by tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental metrics of immunogenicity and differential expression of immunotherapy target genes. In luminal-A breast cancer, an IGX involving MEN1 deletion combined with reduced levels of neutrophils associated with lower progression-free survival and deregulation of immune signaling pathways, as observed in two independent cancer genomics datasets. These results showcase the ability of PACIFIC to integrate complex multi-omics datasets with clinical information, enabling the identification of clinically relevant immunogenomic interactions. Such interactions provide a rich set of hypotheses for mechanistic studies and the development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

40778665,Impact of Genetic Ancestry on Genomics and Survival Outcomes in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"The influence of genetic ancestry on genomics in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has not been fully explored. We examined the impact of genetic ancestry on multiomic alterations, survival outcomes, and risk stratification. Among 1,309 children and young adults with T-ALL treated on the Children's Oncology Group trial AALL0434, the prognostic value of five commonly altered T-ALL genes varied by ancestry-including NOTCH1, which was associated with superior overall survival for patients of European ancestry but was nonprognostic among patients of African ancestry. Integrating genetic ancestry with published T-ALL risk classifiers, we identified that an X01 penalized Cox regression classifier stratified patients regardless of ancestry, whereas a European multigene classifier misclassified patients of certain ancestries. Overall, 80% of patients harbored a genomic alteration in at least one gene with differential prognostic impact in an ancestry-specific manner. These data demonstrate the importance of incorporating genetic ancestry into genomic risk classification. There is a lack of studies examining the prognostic significance of genomic features by genetic ancestry in T-ALL, especially in non-European ancestral groups. In this study, we demonstrate how the prognostic value of individual alterations differs by genetic ancestry, warranting future studies to identify germline alleles affecting these associations.

40874981,Melanocortin System Activates Carotid Body Arterial Chemoreceptors in Hypertension.,"The internal milieu of the body is controlled by a system of interoceptors coupled to motor outflows that drive compensatory adaptive responses. These include the arterial chemoreceptors, best known for sensing arterial oxygen. In cardiometabolic diseases, such as essential hypertension, the carotid bodies (CB) exhibit heightened reflex sensitivity and tonic activity without an apparent stimulus. The mechanisms behind CB sensitization in these conditions are not well understood. Guided by functional genomics, a range of functional assays is used to interrogate downstream intracellular and interorgan signaling pathways involved in arterial chemosensory function. Here, we report the presence of the MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor) in the mammalian CB and show its elevated expression in experimental hypertension. We demonstrate that melanocortin agonists activate arterial chemosensory cells, modulating CB chemosensory afferent drive to influence chemoreflex-evoked sympathetic and ventilatory activity. Transcriptional analysis of hypertensive CB implicates the activation of the Mash1 (mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1; <i>Ascl1</i>) regulatory network in driving elevated <i>Mc4r</i> expression. Collectively, our data indicate a primarily pathophysiological role of melanocortin signaling in arterial chemosensation, contributing to excess sympathetic activity in cardiometabolic disease.","Pauza, Audrys G; Thakkar, Pratik; Shen, Xin; Felippe, Igor S A; Roßmann, Kilian; Oya, Manami; McBryde, Fiona D; Nakamura, Kazuhiro; Broichhagen, Johannes; Hodson, David J; Pauza, Dainius H; Murphy, David; Paton, Julian F R","Molecular Neuroendocrinology Research Group, Bristol Medical School, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom (A.G.P., D.M.).; Department of Physiology, Manaaki Mānawa- The Centre for Heart Research, Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand (A.G.P., P.T., X.S., I.S.A.F., F.D.M., J.F.R.P.).; Department of Integrative Physiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan (M.O., K.N.).; Institute of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania (D.H.P.).; Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (OCDEM), NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Churchill Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom (D.J.H.).; Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany (K.R., J.B.).",Circulation research,Circ Res,"Carotid Body, Animals, Hypertension, Chemoreceptor Cells, Male, Mice, Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Signal Transduction, Melanocortins, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors",2025,08,26,2025,09,17,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40874981,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.125.326394,40874981,0,0,NONE
40799140,TBX5 and CHD4 Coordinately Activate Atrial Cardiomyocyte Genes to Maintain Cardiac Rhythm Homeostasis.,"Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained arrhythmia, affects 59 million individuals worldwide. The transcription factor TBX5 (T-box 5) is essential for normal atrial rhythm. Its inactivation causes loss of atrial cardiomyocyte (aCM) enhancer accessibility, looping, transcriptional identity, and spontaneous atrial fibrillation. TBX5 interacts with CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4), a chromatin remodeling ATPase canonically associated with the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) repressor complex. We investigated mechanisms by which TBX5 regulates chromatin organization by studying mice with aCM-selective inactivation of TBX5 or CHD4. We integrated multiple genomics approaches including concurrent single-nucleus transcriptome and open chromatin profiling and genome-wide TBX5 and CHD4 chromatin occupancy assays. We found that TBX5 recruits CHD4 to 33 170 genomic regions (TBX5-enhanced CHD4 sites). In addition to the canonical repressive activity of CHD4, we uncovered a CHD4 activator function predominantly at sites to which it was recruited by TBX5. TBX5-enhanced CHD4 recruitment increased local chromatin accessibility and promoted the expression of aCM identity genes. This mechanism of CHD4 recruitment by TBX5 was crucial for sinus rhythm; mice with CHD4 inactivation in aCMs had increased atrial fibrillation vulnerability. Assaying TBX5 binding in <i>Chd4</i><sup><i>AKO</i></sup> atria demonstrated that CHD4 also promotes TBX5 binding at >10 000 genomic loci, including 3051 TBX5-enhanced CHD4 sites. Consistent with its requirement to maintain normal atrial rhythm, CHD4 was implicated in the regulation of 42 genes linked to atrial fibrillation in humans. Nine had the hallmarks of TBX5-dependent, CHD4-mediated transcriptional activation. Our findings reveal that normal atrial rhythm requires CHD4, which activates and represses atrial genes in a context-dependent manner to maintain aCM gene expression, aCM identity, and atrial rhythm homeostasis.","Sweat, Mason E; Shi, Wei; Sweat, Yan Y; Li, Jie; Li, Jiajin; Keating, Erin M; Ponek, Anna; Ma, Qing; Park, Chaehyoung; Trembley, Michael A; Wang, Yi; Hou, Cuilan; Bezzerides, Vassilios J; Conlon, Frank L; Pu, William T","Department of Cardiology, Boston Children's Hospital, MA (M.E.S., Y.Y.S., Jie Li, Jiajin Li, E.M.K., A.P., Q.M., C.P., M.A.T., Y.W., C.H., V.J.B., W.T.P.).; Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (W.S., F.L.C.).; Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China (C.H.).; Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, MA (W.T.P.).; Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China (Jie Li).; Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (Jiajin Li).; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (W.S.).",Circulation,Circulation,"Animals, T-Box Domain Proteins, Myocytes, Cardiac, Mice, Heart Atria, Homeostasis, Heart Rate, Atrial Fibrillation, Humans, Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex",2025,08,13,2025,09,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40799140,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.073833,40799140,0,,

Across a sample of 2,153 children (9-11 years old), we address this question, focusing on common genetic variants associated with cognitive ability and diffusion-based structural neuroimaging. Using polygenic scores, we test how variability in the genetic signal associated with cognitive ability is linked to simulated structural network properties, such as network efficiency. We fit a computational model to each connectome that simulates the emergence of high-level network properties. Central to the model is an economic trade-off between the ""cost"" of forming a given connection (a distance penalty) and the topological ""value"" that connection brings to the network. To simulate the network properties of those with the highest genetic propensity for cognitive ability, we had to use a significantly weaker<i>wiring cost</i>penalty. This softer distance penalty produces more stochastic, diverse, and efficient simulated networks. Further, those with a high genetic propensity for cognitive ability exhibited a more randomised simulated topology. Finally, we took a different approach to exploring the relationships between genes and model parameters by linking the<i>distribution</i>of those parameters with post-mortem gene expression data, with a comparative pathway enrichment analysis. Across the sample, overlapping biological and cellular pathways between polygenic scores and each child's optimal cost-value trade-off emerged. Together, the generative wiring distance term, which varied maximally across participants but minimally across the cortex, was enriched for more ontologies than the wiring value term, which varied maximally across the cortex. However, the overlap in enriched ontologies between polygenic scores and the wiring<i>value</i>term was greater than that of polygenic scores and the wiring<i>distance</i>term. This application of computational modelling demonstrates that the underlying economic trade-offs needed to simulate the higher-order topological properties of networks vary according to genetic propensity for cognitive ability.","Monaghan, Alicja; Akarca, Danyal; Astle, Duncan E","Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; The Alan Turing Institute, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)",Imaging Neurosci (Camb),,2025,06,04,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40800854,10.1162/IMAG.a.31,40800854,0,,
40800864,Leveraging multimodal neuroimaging and GWAS for identifying modality-level causal pathways to Alzheimer's disease.,"The UK Biobank study has produced thousands of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) collected from more than 40,000 genotyped individuals so far, facilitating the investigation of genetic and imaging biomarkers for brain disorders. Motivated by efforts in genetics to integrate gene expression levels with genome-wide association studies (GWASs), recent methods in imaging genetics adopted an instrumental variable (IV) approach to identify causal IDPs for brain disorders. However, several methodological challenges arise with existing methods in achieving causality in imaging genetics, including horizontal pleiotropy and high dimensionality of candidate IVs. In this work, we propose testing the causality of each brain modality (i.e., structural, functional, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) for each gene as a useful alternative, which offers an enhanced understanding of the roles of genetic variants and imaging features on behavior by controlling for the pleiotropic effects of IDPs from other imaging modalities. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method by using Alzheimer's GWAS data from the UK Biobank and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) study.

40891781,Novel BEST1 Variant Characterization in a Large French Cohort in Light of Updated Bestrophin-1 Structure-Function Correlation.,"To update knowledge on bestrophin-1 structure and function with the aim of assessing the pathogenicity of variants reported in the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) and in a large French cohort of bestrophinopathies. All unique variants reported in the latest version (October 2024) of the BEST1-LOVD database were uploaded and curated. We described all BEST1 variants identified in French patients analyzed at Lille University Hospital, between 2008 and 2024. A comprehensive analysis of each variant was performed based on in silico tools (at DNA, RNA, and protein levels), as well as a literature review providing clinical data and functional assays. All of these data were used to classify the variant pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. We detailed 488 variants from the LOVD. Among 450 French patients, we identified 150 different variants, 40 of which were novel. We classified only eight variants as variants of unknown significance, four of which were already in the LOVD. We identified specific recurrent variants in the French population: p.(Gly26Asp), p.(Val90Met), p.(Val137Met), and p.(Ile230del), the last of which was present in 17 patients (3.8%). All new variants cause changes in chemical interactions within the protein and are associated with clinical pictures of bestrophinopathy. The study and comparison of these two large cohorts highlight variants specific to the French population, as well as differences in protein distribution, which are undoubtedly influenced by several population-specific factors. Through multiple in silico analyses, we were able to reclassify 93.3% of variants as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, thereby strengthening clinical diagnoses.","Bitan, Joan; Poncet, Anaïs F; Lecigne, Claire; Devos, Aurore; Meunier, Isabelle; Zanlonghi, Xavier; Grunewald, Olivier; Smirnov, Vasily; Dhaenens, Claire-Marie","Institute for Neurosciences of Montpellier, University of Montpellier, INSERM, Montpellier, France.; National Reference Center for Inherited Sensory Diseases, University of Montpellier, CHU, Montpellier, France.; Exploration de la Vision et Neuro-Ophtalmologie, CHU de Lille, Lille, France.; University of Lille, INSERM, CHU-Lille, U1172 - Lille Neuroscience & Cognition Research Center (LilNCog), Lille, France.; Service d'Ophtalmologie, Centre de compétence maladie rare, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, Bretagne, France.",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"Humans, Bestrophins, France, Male, Female, Eye Diseases, Hereditary, Retinal Diseases, Mutation, Structure-Activity Relationship, Middle Aged, Adult, Cohort Studies, Child",2025,09,02,2025,09,06,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40891781,10.1167/iovs.66.12.4,40891781,0,0,NONE
40852779,Causal associations between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders: A Mendelian randomization study.,"ObjectiveSchizophrenia is a globally prevalent complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is frequently comorbid with various psychiatric disorders, leading to poor prognoses for affected patients. However, the causal relationships between schizophrenia and these comorbid disorders remain unclear.MethodsWe utilized Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal effects of schizophrenia on eight psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and other extensive Genome-Wide Association Studies. We employed the inverse variance-weighted method as the primary analysis, complemented by Mendelian randomization-Egger, weighted median, Mendelian randomization-Presso, Steiger filtering, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, and reverse Mendelian randomization to address potential biases and validate the directionality of the causal relationships.ResultsOur analysis revealed that a genetically predicted one-log unit increase in schizophrenia risk was associated with a 70.7% increase in the odds of bipolar disorder (odds ratio: 1.707, 95% confidence interval: 1.58-1.84). We also found strong evidence regarding a causal relationship of schizophrenia with autism spectrum disorders, showing a 17.4% higher odds (odds ratio: 1.174, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.24). Additionally, schizophrenia conferred a 14.5% elevated risk of alcohol use disorder (odds ratio: 1.145, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.21), while a statistically significant yet clinically marginal association was observed with depression (odds ratio: 1.004, 95% confidence interval: 1.003-1.006). No causal relationships were detected between schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sensitivity analyses reinforced these findings, and reverse Mendelian randomization analyses provided no evidence of reverse causal impacts on schizophrenia from the disorders examined.ConclusionThese findings confirm schizophrenia as a significant genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and alcohol use disorder. Our findings enhance understanding of the interrelationships among psychiatric disorders and offer novel insights into the clinical diagnosis and management of psychiatric comorbidities.","Zhou, Yin; Chen, Yuxiao; Wang, Pengli; Zhang, Kejing; Zhang, Yili","Center for Reproductive Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.; Department of Psychiatry, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University, China.; Department of Psychiatry, Ningbo Psychiatric Hospital, China.; Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China.",The Journal of international medical research,J Int Med Res,"Humans, Mendelian Randomization Analysis, Schizophrenia, Genome-Wide Association Study, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Bipolar Disorder, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Mental Disorders, Odds Ratio",2025,08,25,2025,08,28,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40852779,10.1177/03000605251369855,40852779,0,0,NONE
40847831,Genomic competence among nurses: A spotlight on ethics.,"BackgroundGlobally, ethics is recognized as a critical component for ensuring equitable and sustainable genomic healthcare. However, prior research has largely overlooked the ethical aspects when assessing nurses' genomic competence.Research aimThis study aimed to assess the genomic competence of nurses in Finland, with a specific focus on their perspectives regarding ethics in genomics.Research designThis was a cross-sectional study conducted among registered nurses in Finland.Participants and research contextThe data were collected via an online survey between October 30 and December 31, 2023, using the Canadian Adaptation of the Genetics Genomics Nursing Practice Survey (GGNPS-CA), which evaluates attitudes, receptivity, confidence, competency, knowledge, social systems, and the decision adoption process in genomics with ethical dimensions. A total of 234 registered nurses participated.Ethical considerationsThe study was ethically approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tampere Region, statement number 46/2023.ResultsWhile 76.8% of nurses rated their self-assessed understanding of genomics as poor, their actual Knowledge Score was relatively good (mean 9.12/12, SD 1.44). In addition, nurses reported limited understanding of the ethical issues associated with genomics, particularly concerning equity. The majority (59.4%) believed it was very important for nurses to become more educated on ethical issues, while 28.6% considered it somewhat important.ConclusionsThe findings suggest a strong perceived need among nurses for further education in both genomics and its ethical implications. The discrepancy between self-assessed and actual knowledge may reflect low confidence, which was additionally reported in the ethical issues. Low confidence is possibly influenced by the early stage of genomics integration into nursing practice.","Laaksonen, Mari; Paavilainen, Eija; Koivisto, Anna-Maija; Halkoaho, Arja",Tampere University.; University of Eastern Finland.; Wellbeing Services County of South Ostrobothnia.; Tampere University of Applied Sciences.,Nursing ethics,Nurs Ethics,,2025,08,23,2025,08,30,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40847831,10.1177/09697330251366594,40847831,0,0,NONE
40917099,Language Modelling Techniques for Analysing the Impact of Human Genetic Variation.,"Interpreting the effects of variants within the human genome and proteome is essential for analysing disease risk, predicting medication response, and developing personalised health interventions. Due to the intrinsic similarities between the structure of natural languages and genetic sequences, natural language processing techniques have demonstrated great applicability in computational variant effect prediction. In particular, the advent of the Transformer has led to significant advancements in the field. However, transformer-based models are not without their limitations, and a number of extensions and alternatives have been developed to improve results and enhance computational efficiency. This systematic review investigates over 50 different language modelling approaches to computational variant effect prediction over the past decade, analysing the main architectures, and identifying key trends and future directions. Benchmarking of the reviewed models remains unachievable at present, primarily due to the lack of shared evaluation frameworks and data sets.","Hegde, Megha; Nebel, Jean-Christophe; Rahman, Farzana","School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Kingston University, London, UK.",Bioinformatics and biology insights,Bioinform Biol Insights,,2025,09,02,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40917099,10.1177/11779322251358314,40917099,0,0,NONE

It is primarily caused by mutations in uromodulin (<i>UMOD</i>) gene. This study reports a family with ADTKD in which whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a missense mutation in the <i>UMOD</i> gene, c.761A>C (p.H254P), present in both the proband and affected relatives. According to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, this variant is classified as likely pathogenic. The mutation results in an amino acid substitution that may impair UMOD protein folding and intracellular trafficking. <i>UMOD</i> gene mutations are associated with ADTKD, and genetic testing plays a vital role in the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition, highlighting its importance in the diagnosis of rare kidney diseases.","Zhang, Yingying; Li, Nannan; Lu, Min; Lei, Yumeng; Zhang, Kaiqian; Liu, Jishi","Department of Nephropathy and Rheumatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013.; Department of Nephropathy and Rheumatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013. 228311021@csu.edu.cn.; Department of Nephropathy and Rheumatology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410013. 26545559@qq.com.; Clinical Research Center for Critical Kidney Disease in Hunan Province, Changsha 410013, China. 26545559@qq.com.",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

40785668,A prognostic model for multiple myeloma based on lipid metabolism related genes.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a highly heterogeneous hematologic malignancy, with disease progression driven by cytogenetic abnormalities and a complex bone marrow microenvironment. This study aims to construct a prognostic model for MM based on transcriptomic data and lipid metabolism related genes (LRGs), and to identify potential drug targets for high-risk patients to support clinical decision-making. In this study, 2 transcriptomic datasets covering 985 newly diagnosed MM patients were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Univariate Cox regression and 101 machine learning algorithms were used for gene selection. An LRG-based prognostic model was constructed using Stepwise Cox (both directions) and random survival forest (RSF) algorithms. The association between the prognostic score and clinical events was evaluated, and model performance was assessed using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the C-index. The added predictive value of combining prognostic scores with clinical variables and staging systems was also analyzed. Differentially expressed genes between high- and low-risk groups were identified using limma and clusterProfiler and subjected to pathway enrichment analysis. Drug sensitivity analysis was conducted using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database and oncoPredict to identify potential therapeutic targets for high-risk patients. The functional role of key LRGs in the model was validated via in vitro cell experiments. An LRG-based prognostic model (LRG17) was successfully developed using transcriptomic data and machine learning. The model demonstrated robust predictive performance, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.962, 0.912, and 0.842 for 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival, respectively. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients showing significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) (both <i>P</i><0.001) and worse clinical profiles (e.g., lower albumin, higher β2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels). Enrichment analysis revealed that high-risk patients were significantly enriched for pathways related to chromosome segregation and mitosis, whereas low-risk patients were enriched for immune response and immune cell activation pathways. Drug screening suggested that <i>AURKA</i> inhibitor BMS-754807 and FGFR3 inhibitor I-BET-762 may be more effective in high-risk patients. Functional assays demonstrated that silencing of key LRG <i>PLA2G4A</i> significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis. LRGs serve as promising biomarkers for prognosis prediction and risk stratification in MM. The overexpression of chromosomal instability-related and high-risk genetic event-associated genes in high-risk patients may explain their poorer outcomes. Given the observed resistance to bortezomib and lenalidomide in high-risk patients, combination therapies involving BMS-754807 or I-BET-762 may represent effective alternatives.","Li, Zhengjiang; Zhao, Liang; Shi, Fangming; Guo, Jiaojiao; Zhou, Wen","Cancer Research Institute, Xiangya School of Basic Medical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078.; Cancer Research Institute, Xiangya School of Basic Medical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078. wenzhou@csu.edu.cn.; Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China. jiaojiao_zhongnan@163.com.; Cancer Research Institute, Xiangya School of Basic Medical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410078. lzj0330@csu.edu.cn.; Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

40887617,Comparative genomics of two closely related Acropora coral species with different spawning seasons reveals genomic regions possibly associated with gametogenesis.,"Marine invertebrates release their gametes at an optimal time to produce the next generation. In reef-building scleractinian corals, synchronous spawning is essential for reproductive success. Molecular mechanisms of scleractinian gametogenesis have been studied; however, the mechanism by which coral gametes mature at specific times has yet to be discovered. The present study focused on two Acropora species with different spawning seasons. In Okinawa, Japan, Acropora digitifera spawns from May to June, whereas Acropora sp. 1 spawns in August. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that 60 genes are located in the diverged genomic regions between the two species, suggesting a possible association with timing of gametogenesis. Among candidate genes, we identified an Acropora sp. 1-specific amino acid change in gene WDR59, one of the components of a mTORC1 activator, GATOR2. Since regulation of gametogenesis by mTORC1 is widely conserved among eukaryotes, the difference in timing of gamete maturation observed in the two Acropora species may be caused by a substitution in WDR59 that slightly affects timing of mTORC1 activation via GATOR2. In addition, this substitution may lead to reproductive isolation between the two species, due to different spawning periods. Thus, we propose that A. digitifera and Acropora sp. 1 species pair is an effective model for studying coral speciation and understanding the molecular mechanisms that control coral spawning timing.","Takahashi-Kariyazono, Shiho; Iguchi, Akira; Terai, Yohey","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Geological Survey of Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.; Research Laboratory on Environmentally-Conscious Developments and Technologies, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ibaraki, 305-8567, Japan.; Research Center for Integrative Evolutionary Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Shonan Village, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan. terai_yohei@soken.ac.jp.; Research Center for Integrative Evolutionary Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Shonan Village, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan. kariyazono.s@aist.go.jp.; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Geological Survey of Japan, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. kariyazono.s@aist.go.jp.",BMC ecology and evolution,BMC Ecol Evol,"Animals, Anthozoa, Gametogenesis, Seasons, Japan, Genome, Reproduction, Genomics",2025,09,01,2025,09,03,22J40115_NONE_Japan Society for the Promotion of Science_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40887617,10.1186/s12862-025-02432-5,,,,

40790547,Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes in lycoperdaceae fungi reveals intron dynamics and phylogenetic relationships.,"The fungi of the Lycoperdaceae family are characterized by their nearly spherical fruiting bodies and possess pharmacological, economic, and ecological values. As a group of highly valuable fungi, the classification of species within the Lycoperdaceae family continues to be a subject of debate. Mitochondrial genomes typically harbor considerable number of genes and genetic elements that offer a wealth of genetic information, making them widely utilized in phylogenetic studies of eukaryotes. However, mitochondrial genome data for the Lycoperdaceae family is insufficient, and investigating its structure offers valuable insights into the evolutionary relationships between puffball fungi and other Agaricales taxa. In this study, we sequenced and compared the complete mitogenomes of four species of Lycoperdon and Calvatia for the first time. Comparative analysis indicated that introns and open reading frames (ORFs) influence mitochondrial genome size variation among the four species. The gene lengths and nucleotide compositions varied across the species, and synteny analysis suggested potential gene loss during Lycoperdaceae evolution. Phylogenetic relationships of 50 Agaricales and 16 Boletales species were reconstructed based on a concatenated mitochondrial gene dataset. The results elucidated the taxonomic placements of four Lycoperdaceae species within the Agaricales, confirming the monophyly of Lycoperdaceae and its nested position within Agaricaceae. With the expansion of the phylogenetic tree, the number of introns gradually decreased across the Boletales. Additionally, significant inversion and translocation events were observed in the tRNA genes of Lycoperdon pratense. This study represents the first assembly of complete mitogenomes for four species within the Lycoperdaceae family, laying the foundation for subsequent phylogenetic research based on fungal mitochondrial gene dataset. Comparative analysis revealed the contribution of gene composition and introns to the mitochondrial genome size. Their mitochondrial genomes underwent frequent intron loss or gain events and potential intron transfer in evolution.","Wang, Xianyi; Wang, Guoyu; Tao, Jiawei; Guo, Zhongyao; Xu, Guangyin; Li, Jiayu; Kang, Jichuan; Zuo, Qin; Liu, Hongmei; Li, Qirui","State Key Laboratory of Discovery and Utilization of Functional Components in Traditional Chinese Medicine and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guian New District, Guizhou, China. wby200222@163.com.; The High Efficacy Application of Natural Medicinal Resources Engineering Centre of Guizhou Province (The Key Laboratory of Optimal Utilization of Natural Medicine Resources), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guian New District, Guizhou, China.; The High Efficacy Application of Natural Medicinal Resources Engineering Centre of Guizhou Province (The Key Laboratory of Optimal Utilization of Natural Medicine Resources), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guian New District, Guizhou, China. lqrnd2008@163.com.; State Key Laboratory of Discovery and Utilization of Functional Components in Traditional Chinese Medicine and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guian New District, Guizhou, China.; Engineering Research Center of Medical Biotechnology, School of Biology and Engineering, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. gzuhmliu@126.com.; Engineering Research Center of Medical Biotechnology, School of Biology and Engineering, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.; State Key Laboratory of Discovery and Utilization of Functional Components in Traditional Chinese Medicine and School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guian New District, Guizhou, China. lqrnd2008@163.com.; Engineering and Research Centre for Southwest Bio-Pharmaceutical, Resources of National Education Ministry of China, Guizhou University, Guiyang, China.",BMC genomics,BMC Genomics,"Phylogeny, Introns, Genome, Mitochondrial, Evolution, Molecular, Agaricales, Open Reading Frames, Genomics",2025,08,11,2025,08,14,"gzwkj 2021-510_NONE_The Science and Technology Foundation of Health Commission of Guizhou Province_; Grant No. 32170019_NONE_The National Natural Science Foundation of China_; Qian Ke He Foundation-ZK (2024) General 128_NONE_The Science and Technology Program of Guizhou Province_; Qian Jiao Ji No (2023) 036_NONE_The special funds from the central finance to support the development of local universities_; J (2022) 052_NONE_The High-Level Talent Initiation Project of Guizhou Medical University_; FAMP2021Z1-1_NONE_The project of State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, and the Guizhou Medical University_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40790547,10.1186/s12864-025-11911-4,40790547,0,,
40836206,Comparative genomic insights into ecological adaptations and evolutionary dynamics of Trebouxiophyceae algae.,"The Trebouxiophyceae is a diverse and species-rich class within the Chlorophyta, exhibiting a wide array of lineages and remarkable variations in morphology and ecology. This group encompasses various lifestyles, including photobionts in symbiotic relationships, free-living forms, and parasitic heterotrophs lacking photosynthetic capacity. Trebouxiophycean algae have attracted considerable scientific interest due to their fundamental biological significance and their promising applications in biotechnology. This study presents a comprehensive genomic analysis of six newly sequenced strains of Trebouxiophyceae, expanding upon a foundation of 25 previously reported high-quality genomes to conduct comparative genomics and evolutionary assessments. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 18 S rDNA and single-copy orthologues confirmed the accurate identification of species. The analyzed strains exhibited variable genome sizes ranging from 2.37 Mb to 106.45 Mb, with GC content varying between 46.19% and 67.20%, and repeat content ranging from 1.67 to 19.73%. Gene family expansion and contraction analyses revealed that the subaerial species Apatococcus exhibited the most extensive expansions, while Picochlorum, along with the ancestors of the parasitic genera (Auxenochlorella, Helicosporidium, and Prototheca) experienced pronounced contractions. Evolutionary analyses using the branch model and branch-site model in PAML indicated that genera with the most marked gene family expansion and contraction also contained orthogroups undergoing positive selection and rapid evolution. Comparative assessments of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), nitrogen transport and assimilation proteins, hexose-proton symporter-like genes (HUP1, HUP2, and HUP3), and C<sub>4</sub>-related enzymes across 31 Trebouxiophyceae genomes revealed further patterns of adaptation. Coccomyxa was the only genus containing all the ten types of BGCs, while most other genera exhibited relatively fewer BGCs. The nitrate transporter and the urea active transporter were both absent in the three parasitic genera, and urease, the urease accessory proteins and arginase were nearly universally missing in all the species. All the species possessed the HUP1, HUP2, and HUP3 genes, except that HUP2 was absent in Prototheca and Picochlorum, and the relative abundances of the three genes varied among genera. The NAD-ME, and PCK subtypes of C<sub>4</sub>-related genes were widely distributed in all the samples, while the malate dehydrogenase (NADP+) was identified only in the four freshwater strains belonging to Chlorella and Coccomyxa. Expanded gene families, along with the rapid evolution and positive selection genes, likely played important roles in environmental adaption across terrestrial and marine habitat. Conversely, genome streamlining due to widespread gene families likely contributed to the parasitic heterotrophic lifestyles. Additionally, the distribution of BGCs, nitrogen transport proteins and HUP-like genes, and the types of C<sub>4</sub>-related enzymes perhaps highlighted the potential of Trebouxiophyceae to adapt to complex and varied environmental conditions.","Xiong, Qian; Zheng, Luqin; Zhang, Qi; Li, Tianli; Zheng, Lingling; Song, Lirong","National Aquatic Biological Resource Center, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430072, China. lrsong@ihb.ac.cn.; Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430072, China. lrsong@ihb.ac.cn.; Key Laboratory of Lake and Watershed Science for Water Security, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430072, China.; Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430072, China.; National Aquatic Biological Resource Center, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430072, China.; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.",BMC genomics,BMC Genomics,"Phylogeny, Genomics, Evolution, Molecular, Chlorophyta, Adaptation, Physiological",2025,08,20,2025,08,25,Grant No.2021xjkk0600_NONE_Supported by the Third Xinjiang Scientific Expedition Program_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836206,10.1186/s12864-025-11933-y,40836206,0,0,NONE
40836223,Complete mitochondrial genomes of the Prototheca genus: comparative genomics and evolutionary insights.,"Prototheca (Chlorophyta: Trebouxiophyceae) is a genus of non-photosynthetic microalgae that causes increasingly frequent infections in both humans and animals, collectively referred to as protothecosis The genetic landscape of the Prototheca algae has remained largely uncharted until recent advances in sequencing and genomics. In this study, a combination of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies was employed for sequencing of 18 mitochondrial genomes, representing all currently recognized Prototheca species. The genomes differed in terms of size and GC content, ranging from 38 kbp to 68 kbp and from 25 to 30%, respectively. The gene content and gene order within the mitochondrial DNA exhibited specific characteristics. The gene content was conserved but showed variable number of hypothetical proteins and a clustering tendency for nad genes. Noteworthy, most genes were located on the clockwise strand, with type I introns, containing long open reading frames encoding homing endonucleases, suggesting a mechanism for intron mobility and genome plasticity. Comparative genomic analyses and phylogenetic classification across the 21 core genes showed a close relationship between the mitochondrial genomes, as evidenced by average nucleotide identity (ANI) and average amino acid identity (AAI), supportive for the current cytb gene-based taxonomy. The phylogenetic tree constructed from concatenated alignments of the core genes confirmed the presence of three distinct Prototheca clades, indicating the polyphyletic nature of the genus. In conclusion, this work provides another important step toward elucidating the genetics of Prototheca algae, serving as a framework for future studies on the phylogeny and evolution of these peculiar microorganisms.","Wibberg, Daniel; Bakuła, Zofia; García-Cunchillos, Iván; Gawor, Jan; Gromadka, Robert; Karnkowska, Anna; Bielecki, Jacek; Jagielski, Tomasz","DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.; Institute of Bio- and Geosciences IBG-5 - Computational Metagenomics, Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, Bielefeld, Germany.; Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec), Genome Research of Industrial Microorganisms, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.; Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. t.jagielski@uw.edu.pl.; Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.; Institute of Evolutionary Biology, Faculty of Biology, Biological and Chemical Research Centre, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.",BMC genomics,BMC Genomics,"Genome, Mitochondrial, Phylogeny, Genomics, Evolution, Molecular, Prototheca, Base Composition",2025,08,21,2025,08,23,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836223,10.1186/s12864-025-11952-9,40836223,0,0,NONE
40890591,Novel genomics insights into the molecular evolution of long-distance migratory mammals.,"Understanding the genetic basis of long-distance migration in mammals provides important insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that enable species to adapt to changing environments. Despite its ecological significance, the molecular factors underlying this complex trait remain poorly understood. Our analyses reveal distinct evolutionary signatures associated with long-distance migration in mammals. Through comparative genomics analyses of representative mammalian genomes, we identified multiple genes under positive selection, exhibiting accelerated evolutionary rates, or showing significant correlation with long-distance migration. These genes are predominantly involved in functions related to memory, sensory perception, and locomotor abilities. Additionally, evidence of convergent evolution was detected in genes associated with key biological processes such as energy metabolism, genomic stability, and stress response. Our findings reveal novel molecular signatures linked to long-distance migration in mammals, shedding light on the evolutionary adaptations that support this behavior. This study enhances understanding of how genetic changes contribute to complex migratory traits and offers a foundation for future research on mammalian adaptation to environmental challenges.","Yuan, Hao; Xu, Duo; Xu, Guiping; Yang, Guang","Jiangsu Key Laboratory for the Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Utilization in the Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Basin, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China.; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for the Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Utilization in the Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River Basin, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210023, China. gyang@njnu.edu.cn.; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, 511458, China. gyang@njnu.edu.cn.",BMC genomics,BMC Genomics,"Animals, Evolution, Molecular, Genomics, Mammals, Animal Migration, Selection, Genetic, Phylogeny, Genome",2025,09,02,2025,09,04,"grant nos. 32030011, U24A20362_NONE_the National Natural Science Foundation of China_; GML2021 GD0805_NONE_PI Project of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)_; grant no.

40841932,Genome sequencing and physiological characterization of three Neoarthrinium moseri strains.,"Fungi play essential ecological roles and have been utilized by humans for diverse applications such as industrial enzyme production or as sources of bioactive compounds. Recent research has highlighted the Amphisphaeriales order (Ascomycota) as promising producers of secondary metabolites of pharmaceutical importance. Within this family, the recently established genus Neoarthrinium includes species such as N. brasiliense, N. lithocarpicola, N. moseri, N. trachycarpi, and N. urticae. Existing literature has primarily focused on the taxonomy and phylogeny of Neoarthrinium, leaving its physiology, ecology, and metabolic potential unexplored. This study presents the first investigation of the metabolic and genomic potential of N. moseri. We describe the isolation of two South-Asian N. moseri strains and the genome sequencing of these strains alongside the Colombian ex-type strain for the species. Comparative genome analysis reveals an exceptionally high number of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), surpassing those of many other fungi in the Amphisphaeriales order. Additionally, the genome of N. moseri contains a diverse repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), supporting its hypothesized ecological role as a phyllosphere fungus (putatively an endophyte and/or saprotroph). Ecophysiological assays, including BIOLOG phenotyping, demonstrate its ability to utilize a broad range of carbon sources, emphasizing ecological versatility. This study highlights N. moseri as a promising candidate for secondary metabolite discovery, providing foundational insights into the metabolic and genomic potential of the Neoarthrinium genus and related fungi.","Hochenegger, Nadine J; Vignolle, Gabriel A; Schmal, Matthias; Mach, Robert L; Mach-Aigner, Astrid R; Rahimi, Mohammad Javad; Chan, Chin Mei; Cai, Feng M; Druzhinina, Irina S; Zimmermann, Christian","Institute of Chemical, Environmental and Bioscience Engineering, TU Wien, Gumpendorfer Strasse 1a, Wien, 1060, Austria. christian.zimmermann@tuwien.ac.at.; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Green, Richmond Surry, TW9 3AE, UK.; Institute of Chemical, Environmental and Bioscience Engineering, TU Wien, Gumpendorfer Strasse 1a, Wien, 1060, Austria.; Goodman-Luskine Microbiome Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; School of Ecology, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, 518107, China.; Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Bandar Seri Begawan, Jalan Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam.; The Vatche and Tamar Manoukian Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.",BMC microbiology,BMC Microbiol,"Genome, Fungal, Phylogeny, Ascomycota, Whole Genome Sequencing, Multigene Family, Secondary Metabolism",2025,08,21,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40841932,10.1186/s12866-025-04274-z,40841932,0,0,NONE
40781704,Genome-wide identification and analysis of the cytochrome P450 family elucidate flavonoid biosynthesis in safflower.,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) has been widely utilized for oil production, textile dyeing and traditional medicinal application. Flavonoids constitute the predominant secondary metabolites in safflower, demonstrating significant cardioprotective effects. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), crucial regulators of plant growth and secondary metabolite biosynthesis including flavonoids, remain poorly characterized in safflower despite their established roles in other species. In this study, we systematically identified 271 CYP genes from the safflower genome and comprehensively analyzed their physicochemical properties, the phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, chromosomal distributions, syntenic relationships, and tissue-specific expression patterns. Results reveal the 271 CtCYPs genes are separated into 31 different families attributing to 8 clans based on phylogenetic relationship and sequence similarity. Through integrated analysis of tandem duplication events, comparative genomics, and correlation studies between gene expression and flavonoid accumulation, we ultimately identified four key CYP candidate genes (CtCYP89A1, CtCYP82C2, CtCYP71A4, and CtCYP93A6) potentially involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoid compounds in Carthamus tinctorius. Our findings provide critical gene resources for developing high flavonoids in flowers of safflower cultivars through targeted breeding strategies.","Wu, Yao; Wang, Hualei; Liu, Hongchang; Li, Dandan","College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Huaxi, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China. hcliu@gzu.edu.cn.; College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Huaxi, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China.; Guizhou Key Laboratory for Germplasm Innovation and Resource-Efficient Utilization of Dao-Di Herbs, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China. hcliu@gzu.edu.cn.; College of Agriculture, Guizhou University, Huaxi, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China. ddli3@gzu.edu.cn.; Guizhou Key Laboratory for Germplasm Innovation and Resource-Efficient Utilization of Dao-Di Herbs, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China.; Guizhou Key Laboratory for Germplasm Innovation and Resource-Efficient Utilization of Dao-Di Herbs, Guiyang, Guizhou, 550025, China. ddli3@gzu.edu.cn.",BMC plant biology,BMC Plant Biol,"Carthamus tinctorius, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Flavonoids, Phylogeny, Genome, Plant, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Plant Proteins, Multigene Family, Genes, Plant",2025,08,08,2025,08,12,ZK[2022]064_NONE_Guizhou Province Science and Technology Projects_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40781704,10.1186/s12870-025-06998-6,40781704,0,,
40826032,Furanocoumarins in two European species of Heracleum: transcriptomic and metabolomic study.,"Species of the Apiaceae family produce furanocoumarins-photosensitizing substances widely used in pharmacology. Among them, certain species of the genus Heracleum, commonly known as ""giant hogweeds"", are particularly renowned for their photosensitizing properties. While the metabolic composition of these plants has been studied extensively, their genomics remains largely unexplored, as does the biosynthesis of furanocoumarins within the genus. The reasons behind the increased photosensitivity of giant hogweeds compared to other Heracleum species remain unclear. A comparison of the genomic features and furanocoumarin content of the aboveground organs in two Heracleum species was carried out: H. sosnowskyi, a giant hogweed with strong photosensitizing activity, and H. sibiricum, a non-invasive and ""harmless"" species. Both species produce all known angular and linear compounds of the furanocoumarin synthesis pathway (from umbelliferone to isopimpinellin). The genomes of both species possess homologues of genes involved in the biosynthesis of both angular and linear furanocoumarins. However, the two species differ significantly in the quantity of those compounds. H. sibiricum synthesizes angular furanocoumarins in a much lower level, probably due to lack of the gene for umbelliferon-8-dimetylallyl transferase enzyme. H. sosnowskyi accumulates significantly higher level of xanthotoxin. Interpopulation differences were observed in both the compound content and the expression level of biosynthetic genes. This study represents the first comparative analysis of genomic and metabolic data for closely related Heracleum species in relation to furanocoumarin biosynthesis.","Shtratnikova, Victoria Yu; Bogdanov, Viktor P; Schelkunov, Mikhail I; Klepikova, Anna V; Kulbachnaya, Mariya A; Obukhova, Ekaterina N; Ptitsyna, Elena V; Ezhova, Margarita A; Penin, Aleksey A; Logacheva, Maria D","Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, Lomonosov Moscow State University, H.1, Bld.73, Leninskie Gory, Moscow, 119991, Russian Federation.; Belozersky Research Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, H. 1, Bld. 40, Leninskye Gory, Moscow, 119992, Russian Federation. vtosha@yandex.ru.; Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, H. 3, Gubkina str., Moscow, 119991, Russian Federation.; Moscow Center for Advanced Studies, H. 20, Kulakova Str., Moscow, 123592, Russian Federation.; Belozersky Research Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, H. 1, Bld. 40, Leninskye Gory, Moscow, 119992, Russian Federation.; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, H. 30, Bld. 1, Bolshoy Boulevard, Moscow, 121205, Russian Federation.; Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, H.1, Bld.12, Leninskie Gory, Moscow, 119991, Russian Federation.",BMC plant biology,BMC Plant Biol,"Furocoumarins, Heracleum, Metabolomics, Transcriptome, Species Specificity, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Expression Profiling",2025,08,18,2025,09,14,FFRW-2024-0003_NONE_State assignment of Vavilov Institute of general genetics_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40826032,10.1186/s12870-025-07042-3,40826032,0,,

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of A. beshanzuensis was assembled using a combination of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. The mitochondrial genome is 1.06 Mb in size with a GC content of 45.97%, and consists of nine linear chromosomes and one circular chromosome. Comprehensive analyses, including genome annotation, structural comparisons, RNA editing site prediction, and phylogenetic reconstruction, were subsequently conducted.

40890586,Using landscape genomics to infer genomic regions involved in environmental adaptation of soybean genebank accessions.,"Understanding how crops adapt to specific environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important in the face of accelerating climate change, but the genetics of local adaptation remains little understood for many crops. Landscape genomics can reveal patterns of genetic variation that indicate adaptive diversification during crop evolution and dispersal. Here, we examine genetic differentiation and association signatures with environmental gradients in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) germplasm groups from China that were inferred from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection (<i>N</i> = 17, 019 accessions) based on population structure and passport information. We recover genes previously known to be involved in soybean environmental adaptation and report numerous new candidate genes in adaptation signatures implicated by genomic resources such as the genome annotation and gene expression datasets to function in flowering regulation, photoperiodism and stress reaction cascades. Linkage disequilibrium network analysis suggested functional relationships between genomic regions with signatures of genetic differentiation, consistent with a polygenic nature of environmental adaptation. We tested whether haplotypes associated with environmental adaptation in China were present in 843 North American and 160 European soybean cultivars and found that haplotypes in major genes for early maturity have been selected during breeding, but also that a large number of haplotypes exhibiting putative adaptive variation for cold regions at high latitudes are underrepresented in modern cultivars. Our results demonstrate the value of landscape genomics analysis of genebank accessions studying crop environmental adaptation and to inform future research and breeding efforts for improved adaptation of soybean and other crops to future climates.

40849662,MRD4U: A path to development for personalized liquid biopsy for children with central nervous system tumors.,"Liquid biopsy assays using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can revolutionize care for children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors by enabling precise monitoring of therapeutic responses and detecting recurrence or measurable residual disease (MRD). These assays can detect cell-free, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) via somatic alterations, though accurately measuring low-abundance ctDNA in CSF is challenging. Our research focused on the optimization of next-generation sequencing library preparation from cell-free DNA (cfDNA), evaluating four commercial kits to address the low nucleic acid yield in CSF-derived cfDNA. The selected kit minimized false positives and detected somatic variants at 5% variant allele frequency using 0.1 ng input of synthetic cfDNA, suitable for low-volume CSF samples. We then applied our optimized workflow to six children with CNS tumors using a personalized hybrid-capture sequencing strategy (""MRD4U""), in which individualized panels were designed based on each patient's tumor sequencing. Using MRD4U, we identified ctDNA in two samples, even though neither patient had radiographic or clinical evidence of disease at the time of liquid biopsy. Notably, one ctDNA-positive patient developed radiographic recurrence four months later, demonstrating the assay's potential to detect molecular relapse ahead of conventional clinical measures. These findings demonstrate applicability of our personalized MRD4U assay in early detection of disease recurrence. Unlike non-targeted or tumor-agnostic CSF liquid biopsy approaches, MRD4U leverages patient-specific genomic information to enable sensitive, tumor-informed monitoring that can be deployed across a wide range of pediatric CNS tumors. Our approach is broadly applicable to any tumor type with existing genomic data, enabling ctDNA detection across diverse diagnoses. Ultimately, this strategy may inform clinical decision-making and enable earlier therapeutic intervention.","Miller, Anthony R; Shah, Tithi; Strawser, Corinne N; Rivaldi, Adithe; Wilson, Sarah A; Zhong, Huachun; Lucyshyn, Jocelyn M; Garfinkle, Elizabeth Ar; McCoy, Makenna; Cummins, Seth; Bravo, Alejandro Otero; Chang, Peter; Wheeler, Gregory L; Gordon, David M; Kelly, Benjamin J; Evanovich, Caitlyn; Potter, Samara L; Varga, Elizabeth A; Rodriguez, Diana P; Wilson, Richard K; Cottrell, Catherine E; Salloum, Ralph; Khan, Sara; Fouladi, Maryam; Mardis, Elaine R; Lazow, Margot A; Miller, Katherine E","Department of Radiology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA.; Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, OH, USA.; Steve and Cindy Rasmussen Institute for Genomic Medicine, Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.

40813664,Opportunities for a national genomic data governance framework in Australia: a systematic review.,"As with other countries, Australia is seeking to make efficient use of genomic data for use in research, clinical medicine and population health. However, to enable cross jurisdictional consistency in the management of and access to data, it will first need to establish a national framework for governing genomic data. To this end, ethical, legal and social issues are often discussed. However, the literature offers little evidence-based support for such a framework. To address this literature gap, we systematically reviewed two databases (Scopus and PubMed) for research articles that discussed issues and opportunities for enacting genomic data governance frameworks in the domains of research, genomic medicine and public (population) health in the Australian context. Thirty-one relevant articles were included and were analysed using inductive content analysis. Our findings identified that opportunities for implementing a national genomic data governance framework concerned defining roles for patients in data governance, data management processes and increasing the public acceptance of genomic data use in healthcare and research. Additionally, they highlight differences in the opportunities and priorities for clinical and research genomics that hinder further advancement of data governance. Our synthesis of the current literature on genomic data governance suggests that the current focus on individual consent as the primary mechanism for protecting data subjects and different priorities in clinical and research governance need to be addressed. Given the significance of the role of consent procedures and differences in clinical and research data in generating a data governance framework, our findings hence reveal a critical gap in the research literature. Advancing a national genomic data governance framework will require greater consensus and clarity regarding the application of ethical principles across jurisdictions and institutions.","Cannizzo, Fabian; Vidgen, Miranda E; McWhirter, Rebekah; Petersen, Alan; Otlowski, Margaret; Rizzi, Marco; Hensley, Jasmine; Newson, Ainsley J","ANU College of Law, Governance and Policy, Australian National University, Australian Capital Territory, Canberra, ACT, 2601, Australia.; Centre for Law and Genetics, School of Law, College of Arts, Law and Education, University of Tasmania, Sandy Bay, TAS, 7005, Australia.; QIMR Berghofer, Herston, QLD, 4006, Australia.; Centre for Health Law and Policy, UWA School of Law, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.; School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia.; School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia. fabian.cannizzo@monash.edu.; Sydney Health Ethics, Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia.; UWA School of Law, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.",BMC medical ethics,BMC Med Ethics,"Humans, Australia, Genomics, Data Management, Informed Consent, Biomedical Research",2025,08,14,2025,08,26,MRF2015531_NONE_Australian Government_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40813664,10.1186/s12910-025-01273-7,40813664,0,,
40830465,Adaptive genetics reveals constraints on protein structure/function by evolving E. coli under constant nutrient limitation.,"Evolution of microbes under laboratory selection produces genetically diverse populations, owing to the continuous input of mutations and to competition among lineages. Whole-genome whole-population sequencing makes it possible to identify mutations arising in such populations, to use them to discern functional modules where adaptation occurs, and then map gene structure-function relationships. Here, we report on the use of this approach, adaptive genetics, to discover targets of selection and the mutational consequences thereof in E. coli evolving under chronic nutrient limitation. Replicate bacterial populations were cultured for ≥ 300 generations in glucose limited chemostats and sequenced every 50 generations at 1000X-coverage, enabling identification of mutations that rose to ≥ 1% frequency. Thirty-nine genes qualified as high value targets of selection, being mutated far more often than would be expected by chance. A majority of these encode regulatory proteins that control gene expression at the transcriptional (e.g., RpoS and OmpR), post-transcriptional (e.g., Hfq and ProQ), and post-translational (e.g., GatZ) levels. The downstream effects of these regulatory mutations likely impact not only acquisition and processing of limiting glucose, but also assembly of structural elements such as lipopolysaccharide, periplasmic glucans, and cell surface appendages such as flagella and fimbriae. Whether regulatory or structural in nature, recurrent mutations at high value targets tend to cluster at sites either known or predicted to be involved in RNA-protein or protein-protein interactions. Our observations highlight the value of experimental evolution as a proving ground for inferences gathered from traditional molecular genetics. By coupling experimental evolution to whole-genome, whole-population sequencing, adaptive genetics makes it possible not only the genes whose mutation confers a selective advantage, but also to discover which residues in which genes are most likely to confer a particular type of selective advantage and why.","Schwartz, Katja; Kinnersley, Margie; Lindsey, Charles Ross; Sherlock, Gavin; Rosenzweig, Frank","School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA. frank.rosenzweig@biology.gatech.edu.; Division of Biological Sciences, The University of Montana, Missoula, MT, 59812, USA. frank.rosenzweig@biology.gatech.edu.; School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, 30332, USA.; Division of Biological Sciences, The University of Montana, Missoula, MT, 59812, USA.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305-5120, USA. gsherloc@stanford.edu.; Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305-5120, USA.",BMC biology,BMC Biol,"Escherichia coli, Adaptation, Biological, Escherichia coli Proteins, Mutation, Structure-Activity Relationship, Evolution, Molecular, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Amino Acid Sequence, Selection, Genetic",2025,08,20,2025,08,23,80NSSC20K0621_NONE_Planetary Science Division_; R35 GM131824_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM131824_NH_NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40830465,10.1186/s12915-025-02331-7,40830465,0,,
40781627,Prediction of human pathogenic start loss variants based on self-supervised contrastive learning.,"Start loss variants are a class of genetic variants that affect the bases of the start codon, disrupting the normal translation initiation process and leading to protein deletions or the production of different proteins. Accurate assessment of the pathogenicity of these variants is crucial for deciphering disease mechanisms and integrating genomics into clinical practice. However, among the tens of thousands of start loss variants in the human genome, only about 1% have been classified as pathogenic or benign. Computational methods that rely solely on small amounts of labeled data often lack sufficient generalization capabilities, restricting their effectiveness in predicting the impact of start loss variants. Here, we introduce StartCLR, a novel prediction method specifically designed for identifying pathogenic start loss variants. StartCLR captures variant context information from different dimensions by integrating embedding features from diverse DNA language models. Moreover, it employs self-supervised pre-training combined with supervised fine-tuning, enabling the effective utilization of both a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results show that StartCLR exhibits strong generalization and superior prediction performance across different test sets. Notably, when trained exclusively on high-confidence labeled data, StartCLR retains or even improves the prediction accuracy despite the reduced amount of labeled data. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of integrating self-supervised contrastive learning with unlabeled data to mitigate the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled start loss variants.","Liu, Jie; Fan, Henghui; Cheng, Na; Su, Yansen; Xia, Junfeng","Information Materials and Intelligent Sensing Laboratory of Anhui Province, Institutes of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, Anhui, China.; School of Biomedical Engineering, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, Anhui, China.; School of Artificial Intelligence, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, Anhui, China.; Information Materials and Intelligent Sensing Laboratory of Anhui Province, Institutes of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, 230601, Anhui, China. jfxia@ahu.edu.cn.",BMC biology,BMC Biol,"Humans, Genetic Variation, Codon, Initiator, Supervised Machine Learning, Computational Biology",2025,08,08,2025,08,12,U22A2038_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 62402006_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40781627,10.1186/s12915-025-02348-y,40781627,0,,
40781620,Comparative evaluation of DNA and RNA probes for capture-based mitochondrial DNA next-generation sequencing.,"Probe-based liquid-phase hybridization capture is a powerful and commonly used approach for next-generation sequencing (NGS) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, the performance difference between DNA and RNA probe-based capture strategies for mtDNA NGS remains to be determined, leading to the irrational interchangeable use in numerous studies. We custom-designed DNA and RNA probes targeting the double-stranded mtDNA and optimized their hybridization conditions for capture-based mtDNA NGS in fresh tissue and plasma samples. Under optimal conditions, we systematically compared the performance of DNA and RNA probes in mtDNA detection. RNA probes demonstrated superior mtDNA enrichment efficiency, characterized by higher mtDNA mapping rates and greater average mtDNA depth per gigabyte of sequencing data. However, DNA probes were more effective at reducing artifacts caused by nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) in mtDNA mutation detection at both the read and mutation levels. Additionally, RNA probes captured a broader fragment size distribution and higher prevalence of longer fragments in plasma cell-free mtDNA. The systematic evaluation of DNA and RNA probes in capture-based mtDNA NGS provides valuable insights into their performance differences. These findings advocate for informed probe selection tailored to the specific experimental and clinical needs, ultimately advancing the field of mtDNA characterization and its applications in genomics and diagnostics.","Sun, Tianlei; Li, Shengjing; Liu, Yang; Zhou, Kaixiang; Wang, Jiamin; Lei, Zhangwen; Guo, Xu; Xing, Jinliang; Guo, Wenjie","State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China. xingjl@fmmu.edu.cn.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.; School of Medicine, Northwest University, Xi'an, China.; College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an, China.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China. gwj2002020356@163.com.; State Key Laboratory of Holistic Integrative Management of Gastrointestinal Cancers and Department of Clinical Diagnosis, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.",BMC biology,BMC Biol,"DNA, Mitochondrial, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, RNA Probes, DNA Probes",2025,08,08,2025,08,12,"82402731_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 82020108023_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; CBSKL2022ZZ07_NONE_Autonomous Project of State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40781620,10.1186/s12915-025-02365-x,40781620,0,,
40836298,CUX1 variant and 9p deletion: expanding the spectrum and resolving variable GDD/ID in a family.,"Intellectual disability (ID) significantly impacts individual development and imposes a societal burden. Although mild ID accounts for approximately 85% of total cases, research into its genetic etiology remains relatively limited. We investigated a two-generation pedigree exhibiting varying degrees of global developmental delay (GDD) and ID. We collected clinical data from the proband and her parents, identified the genetic etiology through testing, investigated pathogenic mechanisms, and provided family genetic counseling. Peripheral blood samples were collected from pedigree members for chromosomal karyotyping and genomic DNA extraction. Trio exome sequencing (Trio-ES) was performed on the DNA samples. Candidate variants identified were validated using Sanger sequencing, and their pathogenicity was assessed in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The proband, a 2-year-old female, presented with GDD. Her father exhibited borderline intellectual disability, while her mother had mild intellectual disability. ES analysis revealed: Exome sequencing identified a unknown inheritance heterozygous variant (NM_001202543.2[<i>CUX1</i>]: c.2637G > A [p.Trp879*]) in both the proband and her father, classified as likely pathogenic. The mother carried an 8.60 Mb deletion (seq[hg19]del(9)(p24.3p24.1), which was classified as a pathogenic copy number variant (CNV). Our findings expand the spectrum of genetic variations associated with <i>CUX1</i>-related disorders. The conclusive molecular diagnosis established through genetic testing not only facilitated accurate genetic counseling but also reduced the time and economic burdens associated with the diagnostic odyssey.","Liu, Haiting; Liu, Xiaoyong; Chen, Ximin; Pu, Yangmei; Liu, Wen; Luo, Zemin; Chen, Ai; Zhu, Hui; Xiong, Fu; Zeng, Lan; Wang, Jin; Nie, Xiaocheng; Zhu, Shuyao","Department of Pediatrics, The Second People's Hospital of Chengdu City, Chengdu, China.; Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Neonatology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University/West China women's and children's hospital, Chengdu, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, No. 290 West Second Street, Shayan Road, Chengdu, 610045, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, No. 290 West Second Street, Shayan Road, Chengdu, 610045, China. jinwj521@126.com.; Department of Medical Genetics and Prenatal Diagnosis, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, No. 290 West Second Street, Shayan Road, Chengdu, 610045, China.; Department of Medical Genetics and Prenatal Diagnosis, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, No. 290 West Second Street, Shayan Road, Chengdu, 610045, China. 330986673@qq.com.; Department of Radiology, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, Chengdu, China.; Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sichuan Provincial Woman's and Children's Hospital, No. 290 West Second Street, Shayan Road, Chengdu, 610045, China. niexiaocheng@hotmail.com.",BMC medical genomics,BMC Med Genomics,,2025,08,20,2025,08,23,No. 2022NSFSC0784_NONE_Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province_; 2022-YF05-01243-SN_NONE_Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836298,10.1186/s12920-025-02203-7,40836298,0,0,NONE
40883767,Integration of multi-omics approaches in exploring intra-tumoral heterogeneity.,"Intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is common in malignant tumors and arises from dynamic variations across genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic, and microenvironmental factors. This complexity drives tumor evolution and treatment resistance, undermining the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Despite recent advances in multi-omics technologies that enable comprehensive mapping of ITH across molecular layers, major challenges remain in clinical translation. This review outlines the principles and clinical applications of eight major omics modalities in the context of ITH: genomics, single-cell genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, radiomics, microbiome, and metabolomics. We highlight the unique contributions of each omics platform to tumor profiling and emphasize how their integration enhances biological interpretation, patient stratification, and biomarker discovery. Furthermore, we will focus more extensively on the limitations of applying these approaches to ITH analysis. Instead of providing an exhaustive catalog, this review highlights major controversies, technical hurdles, and conceptual gaps that impede the clinical translation of multi-omics-based ITH analysis, with the aim of addressing ITH-related clinical challenges.","Dong, Mengmeng; Wang, Liping; Hu, Ning; Rao, Yueli; Wang, Zhen; Zhang, Yu","Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.; Center for Laboratory Medicine, Allergy Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, China. wangzhen@hmc.edu.cn.; Department of Gastroenterology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, China. 1013950738@qq.com.; Department of transfudioD Medicine, Joint Service Support Force 903 Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China. raoyueli@sohu.com.; Center for Laboratory Medicine, Allergy Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital People's Hospital, Affiliated People's Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, China.",Cancer cell international,Cancer Cell Int,,2025,08,29,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883767,10.1186/s12935-025-03944-2,40883767,0,0,NONE
40855431,Single-cell multi-omics in cancer immunotherapy: from tumor heterogeneity to personalized precision treatment.,"Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology; however, the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of cancer present substantial challenges to achieving broad therapeutic efficacy. Tumor heterogeneity manifests not only among different patients but also within individual tumors, further complicating personalized treatment approaches. Single-cell sequencing technologies encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and spatial omics have significantly enhanced our ability to dissect tumor heterogeneity at single-cell resolution with multi-layered depth. These approaches have illuminated tumor biology, immune escape mechanisms, treatment resistance, and patient-specific immune response mechanisms, thereby substantially advancing precision oncology strategies. This review systematically examines recent advances in single-cell multi-omics technologies across various cancer research areas, emphasizing their transformative impacts on understanding tumor heterogeneity, immunotherapy, minimal residual disease monitoring, and neoantigen discovery. Additionally, we discuss current technical and analytical limitations and unresolved questions associated with single-cell technologies.

40877920,Construction of lactylation (LA) risk signature in prostate cancer based on 4D fast DIA L-lactated quantitative genomics.,"Lactylation (LA) plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability, angiogenesis, and immune modulation. Global lactylation of proteins in prostate cancer cells is a key event in tumor progression. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of LA in patients with prostate cancer (PRAD) and construct a LA-related risk model to predict prognosis. LA-related genes in prostate cancer were screened through quantitative lactylation proteomics of human tissues from Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University. Based on the TCGA and GEO databases, patients were divided into two LA-related gene clusters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the heterogeneity of the grouping, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the clusters were identified. A LA risk model was constructed using Lasso-Cox regression analysis, and its efficacy was verified in the TCGA, GSE116918, and GSE70769 cohorts through K-M curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and nomograms. The most representative gene, KCNMA1, was selected for in vitro and animal experiments to verify its association with prostate cancer. Based on quantitative lactylation proteomics, two LA clusters were identified in prostate cancer and were significantly associated with prognosis. A total of 122 DEGs were screened to construct a gene risk model. The K-M curves verified the differences between the high - and low - risk groups of the model in the test group and the training cohort (test group: P = 0.025; training group: P < 0.001). The ROC curve verified that the prognostic model had good accuracy. The nomogram integrating staging and LA risk factors showed high accuracy and reliability in predicting the prognosis of prostate cancer. The expression of KCNMA1 in PCa was significantly lower than that in NATs, and its expression level decreased with the increase in grading. In cell experiments, overexpression of KCNMA1 promoted the infiltration of M1 macrophages by inhibiting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Animal experiments demonstrated that overexpression of KCNMA1 inhibited the growth rate of tumors. The LA risk model constructed in this study can effectively predict the prognosis of prostate cancer and is expected to become a new type of test scoring criterion. KCNMA1 is expected to become a novel target for prostate cancer.","Zou, Fan; Jin, Yongchen; Zhang, Ziteng; Zhang, Yishan; Wang, Mingdong; Zhu, Fangge; Qiu, Jinming; Ye, Haoyuan; Fu, Yi; Ping, Hao","Laboratory of Brain Disorders, Beijing Institute of Brain Disorders, Ministry of Science and Technology, Beijing, China. fuyi@ccmu.edu.cn.; Department of Urology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100176, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Disorders, Capital Medical University, No. 10 Xitoutiao, Beijing, 100069, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Disorders, Capital Medical University, No. 10 Xitoutiao, Beijing, 100069, China. fuyi@ccmu.edu.cn.; Laboratory of Brain Disorders, Beijing Institute of Brain Disorders, Ministry of Science and Technology, Beijing, China.; Department of Urology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100176, China. pinghaotrh@ccmu.edu.cn.",Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,"Male, Humans, Prostatic Neoplasms, Genomics, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Cell Line, Tumor, Risk Factors, Animals, Prognosis, Nomograms, Principal Component Analysis, ROC Curve, Mice, Cell Proliferation",2025,08,28,2025,09,01,No. 82272864_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40877920,10.1186/s12967-025-06990-6,,,,
40898230,A roadmap for navigating child health research data sharing across Canada and beyond - building on UCAN CAN-DU.,"Sharing health data within and across jurisdictions is important for research and improving healthcare quality; however, researchers, governments and funders must balance the benefits of data sharing with data privacy. Though frameworks exist to guide data sharing it can be difficult to translate these into practice. Therefore, our aim was to create a practical example of data sharing for researchers in pediatric rheumatology. We utilized expert consultation with leaders in child health, genomics, rheumatology, bioethics, privacy and records, bioinformatics, and legal counsel to better understand barriers and enablers for sharing of health data. We used these barriers to frame the learnings of UCAN CAN-DU (Understanding Childhood Arthritis Network Canada-Netherlands Personalized Medicine Network in Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases) which is a collaboration that collects and shares phenotypic, genomic, health economic and patient reported data across centers in Canada and the Netherlands in order to provide a real-life, practical example of data sharing across borders in pediatric rheumatology. Barriers to data sharing include lack of standardized consent, ethics review processes for multi-site projects, developing data governance frameworks aligned with institutional and regulatory requirements, differing data standards and a lack of interoperability, and managing data access. UCAN CAN-DU provides lessons for navigating these barriers through standardized consent forms, centralized ethics review and reciprocity agreements; building a network to support data interoperability and harmonization of procedures; documentation to support data sharing, including legal agreements, utilization of a secure healthcare data storage compute facility, and a data access advisory committee with clear policies for secondary data use. We have shared how UCAN CAN-DU navigated barriers to data sharing, providing an example of data sharing for researchers in pediatric rheumatology. This work highlights the importance of research networks in establishing interoperability including minimal data sets, standard operating procedures, and institutional legal/contracts partnerships that ultimately support data sharing. The barriers and enablers presented are broadly applicable across countries and provide direction on areas for future research and initiatives to foster data sharing.","Gerber, Brittany; Currie, Gillian R; Mosoiu, Alexander; Bernier, Alexander; Bernier, Francois P; Boycott, Kym M; Fiebelkorn, Guillermo; Hens, Kristien; Knoppers, Bartha M; LeBlanc, Claire; Scherer, Stephen W; Shaw, David; Viney, Chris; Virtanen, Carl; Benseler, Susanne M; Yeung, Rae S M; Marshall, Deborah A","Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.; Chief Academic Office and Head of Pediatrics Health Affairs, Children's Health Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.; Institute of Philosophy, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Centre of Genomics and Policy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.; Department of Genetics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Legal Services , The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; HPC4Health, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.; McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.; Department of Medical Genetics, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. currie@ucalgary.ca.; The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Philosophy, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.; McLaughlin Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.; The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Health Research Innovation Centre, University of Calgary, Room 3C56, 3280 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, AB, T2N 4Z6, Canada. currie@ucalgary.ca.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. currie@ucalgary.ca.; Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. currie@ucalgary.ca.; O'Brien Institute for Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.; Genetics and Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Departments of Pediatrics, Immunology and Medical Science, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Care and Public Health Research Institute, Universiteit Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands.; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, ON.",Pediatric rheumatology online journal,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,,2025,09,02,2025,09,05,174942_CAPMC_ CIHR_Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40898230,10.1186/s12969-025-01139-7,40898230,0,0,NONE
40796877,b-move: faster lossless approximate pattern matching in a run-length compressed index.,"Due to the increasing availability of high-quality genome sequences, pan-genomes are gradually replacing single consensus reference genomes in many bioinformatics pipelines to better capture genetic diversity. Traditional bioinformatics tools using the FM-index face memory limitations with such large genome collections. Recent advancements in run-length compressed indices like Gagie et al.'s r-index and Nishimoto and Tabei's move structure, alleviate memory constraints but focus primarily on backward search for MEM-finding. Arakawa et al.'s br-index initiates complete approximate pattern matching using bidirectional search in run-length compressed space, but with significant computational overhead due to complex memory access patterns. We introduce b-move, a novel bidirectional extension of the move structure, enabling fast, cache-efficient, lossless approximate pattern matching in run-length compressed space. It achieves bidirectional character extensions up to 7 times faster than the br-index, closing the performance gap with FM-index-based alternatives. For locating occurrences, b-move performs <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>ϕ</mi></math> and <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msup><mi>ϕ</mi> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>1</mn></mrow> </msup> </math> operations up to 7 times faster than the br-index. At the same time, it maintains the favorable memory characteristics of the br-index, for example, all available complete E. coli genomes on NCBI's RefSeq collection can be compiled into a b-move index that fits into the RAM of a typical laptop. b-move proves practical and scalable for pan-genome indexing and querying. We provide a C++ implementation of b-move, supporting efficient lossless approximate pattern matching including locate functionality, available at https://github.com/biointec/b-move under the AGPL-3.0 license.","Depuydt, Lore; Renders, Luca; Van de Vyver, Simon; Veys, Lennart; Gagie, Travis; Fostier, Jan","Ghent University-imec, Technologiepark 126, 9052, Ghent, Belgium.

40826089,Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy in china: a novel TYMP variant and comprehensive clinical-genetic insights.,"Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by variants in the TYMP gene, which encodes thymidine phosphorylase (TP). It is characterized by multisystem involvement, with prominent gastrointestinal, neurological, and systemic manifestations that typically exhibit progressive worsening over time. We characterized a multigenerational MNGIE family through comprehensive proband analysis, identifying compound heterozygous TYMP variants (c.131G > C, p.Arg44Pro and c.1268T>G, p.Leu423Arg in trans) as the molecular basis of disease. Extended family testing for genetic counseling confirmed no secondary pathogenic variants. Muscle biopsies were analyzed using comprehensive staining techniques. Genomic analysis involved next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the proband's DNA and Sanger sequencing of family members' DNA to confirm variants. In silico analysis utilized bioinformatics tools and protein modeling to predict pathogenicity and assess structural impacts, with variant classification adhering to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics(ACMG) guidelines. Additionally, a literature review of Chinese MNGIE cases was conducted to contextualize the findings. The proband exhibited characteristic MNGIE features, including gastrointestinal dysmotility, diffuse leukoencephalopathy on brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and electrophysiologically confirmed peripheral neuropathy. Muscle biopsy revealed ragged red fibers, cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibers, and enhanced succinate dehydrogenase activity in blood vessels, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction. Genetic analysis identified a novel TYMP variant (c.1268T > G, p.Leu423Arg) and a known variant (c.131G > C, p.Arg44Pro) in the proband, both classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines. Molecular analysis of other 11 family members detected heterozygous carriers of either the c.1268T > G or c.131G > C variant in six asymptomatic individuals. In silico analysis confirmed that both variants are highly conserved and likely pathogenic. Protein modeling revealed that both variants compromise structural integrity and conformation, impairing TP function. Homozygous or compound heterozygous missense variants were identified as the predominant genetic alterations in 16 Chinese MNGIE cases, with gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms being the most common clinical manifestations. This study enriches the variant spectrum in Chinese patients, highlights the importance of early diagnosis prior to the onset of cachexia and irreversible tissue damage, and enhances the understanding of genetic heterogeneity.","Xu, Xuebi; Xia, Junhui; Xu, Fei; Wang, Mingshan; Yang, Lihong; Chen, Xiaoli","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Shangcai Village, Ouhai District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.

40819054,Genetic testing for oral clefts: reflections based on a single Brazilian public genetics service.,"Genomic medicine has allowed for an improvement in the diagnosis and molecular understanding of congenital defects. However, its implementation into routine clinical practice demands enormous challenges worldwide. This study describes the etiological diversity and access to genetic diagnosis of individuals with oral clefts (OC) at a single genetics service. This cross-sectional and descriptive study analyzed primary records of the Brazilian Database on Craniofacial Anomalies from 2006 to 2019, before the National Policy of Comprehensive Care for People with Rare Diseases (NPCCPRD) implementation in this service. Among 103 individuals (51 Female and 52 Male), the proportion of syndromic OC (SOC) and non-syndromic OC (NSOC) was 73.8% and 26.2%, respectively, showing that NSOC seems not to be referred for genetic evaluation. Diagnosis occurred in 64/103 (62.13%) cases; 36/64 (56,25%) had clinical diagnoses, of which 27/36 were NSOC. The tests allowing a conclusive diagnosis were whole exome sequencing (WES) (11/20-55.00%), followed by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) (4/52-7.69%), Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (6/21-28.57%), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) (2/32-6.25%), and G-banding karyotype (6/72-8.33%). Age at diagnosis ranged from 0 to 46 years (mean = 9.56 /median = 7). Diagnostic investigations of 39/76 SOC cases are still ongoing, relying on clinical follow-up and genetic tests.

40883844,Improving classification on imbalanced genomic data via KDE-based synthetic sampling.,"Class imbalance poses a serious challenge in biomedical machine learning, particularly in genomics, where datasets are characterized by extremely high dimensionality and very limited sample sizes. In such settings, standard classifiers tend to favor the majority class, leading to biased predictions - an especially problematic issue in clinical diagnostics where rare conditions must not be overlooked. In this study, we introduce a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)-based oversampling approach to rebalance imbalanced genomic datasets by generating synthetic minority class samples. Unlike conventional methods such as SMOTE, KDE estimates the global probability distribution of the minority class and resamples accordingly, avoiding local interpolation pitfalls. We evaluate our method on 15 real-world genomic datasets using three classifiers -Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests- and compare it to SMOTE and baseline training. Experimental results demonstrate that KDE oversampling consistently improves classification performance, especially in metrics robust to imbalance, such as AUC of the IMCP curve. Notably, KDE achieves superior results in tree-based models while dramatically simplifying the sampling process. This approach offers a statistically grounded and effective solution for balancing genomic datasets, with strong potential for improving fairness and accuracy in high-stakes medical decision-making.","Taccaliti, Edoardo; Aguilar-Ruiz, Jesus S","Department of Biology, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.; School of Engineering, Pablo de Olavide University, Sevilla, 41013, Spain. aguilar@upo.es.",BioData mining,BioData Min,,2025,08,29,2025,09,15,"PID2023-152660NB-I00_NONE_Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain._",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883844,10.1186/s13040-025-00474-5,40883844,0,0,NONE
40826469,Uncovering the multi-layer cis-regulatory landscape of rice via integrative nascent RNA analysis.,"Efforts to characterize regulatory elements in plant genomes traditionally rely on evolutionary conservation and chromatin accessibility. Recently, intergenic bi-directional nascent transcript has emerged as a putative hallmark of active enhancers. Here, we integrate these approaches to better define the cis-regulatory landscape of the rice genome. In juvenile leaf tissues of the Azucena rice variety, we analyze conserved noncoding sequences, intergenic bi-directional transcripts, and regions of open chromatin. These three features highlight distinct classes of regulatory targets, each exhibiting complexity and regulatory roles. Conserved noncoding sequences are associated with more complex regulatory interactions, while regions marked by chromatin accessibility or bi-directional nascent transcription tend to promote more stable regulatory activity. Some transcribed regulatory sites harbor elements linked to transposable element silencing, whereas others correlate with increased expression of nearby genes, pointing to candidate transcribed regulatory elements. We further identified molecular interactions between genic regions and intergenic transcribed regulatory elements using 3-dimensional chromatin contact data, we identify physical interactions between transcribed intergenic regions and genic regions. These interactions often co-localize with expression quantitative trait loci and coincide with increased transcription, further supporting a regulatory role. Our integrative analysis reveals multiple distinct classes of regulatory elements in the rice genome, with overlapping but non-identical targets and signatures. Many candidate elements share features consistent with transcriptional enhancement, though the specific criteria for defining active enhancers in plants require further characterization. These findings underscore the importance of using complementary genomic signals to discover and characterize functionally diverse regulatory elements in plant genomes.","Goliasse, Marina; Johary, Aurore; Platts, Adrian E; Ortner-Krause, Fabian; Edger, Patrick P; Choi, Jae Young; Purugganan, Michael D; Joly-Lopez, Zoé","Department of Horticulture, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.; Département de Chimie, Université du Québec À Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada. joly-lopez.zoe@uqam.ca.; Département de Chimie, Université du Québec À Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada.; Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, Department of Biology, New York University, New York, NY, USA. mp132@nyu.edu.; Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, NYU Abu Dhabi Research Institute, New York University Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. mp132@nyu.edu.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA.",Genome biology,Genome Biol,"Oryza, Chromatin, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid, RNA, Plant, Quantitative Trait Loci, Conserved Sequence, DNA, Intergenic, DNA Transposable Elements",2025,08,18,2025,09,14,CRC-2021-00126_NONE_Canada Research Chairs_; R35GM154595_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM154595_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; RGPIN-2021-03302_NONE_Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada_; 2029959_NONE_National Science Foundation_; 1929982_NONE_National Science Foundation_; SC0022987_NONE_U.S. Department of Energy_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40826469,10.1186/s13059-025-03715-2,40826469,0,,
40877938,Deep tissue profiling of Populus stem at single nucleus level reveals uncharacterized cell types and cell-specific gene regulatory networks.,"Single-cell genomics is revolutionizing plant developmental biology, enabling the transcriptome profiling of individual cells and their lineage relationships. However, plant cell walls polymers hamper the dissociation and analysis of intact cells. This rigid structure can conceal cell types embedded in complex, lignified, multi-cell layered tissues such as those undergoing secondary growth. Their absence leads to incomplete single-cell genomic atlases and lineage inferences. We isolate nuclei to capture transcripts representing the diversity of cells throughout the stem of the woody perennial Populus trichocarpa generating a high-resolution transcriptome atlas of cell types and lineage trajectories. RNA sequencing of 11,673 nuclei identifies 26 clusters representing cell types in the cambium, xylem, phloem, and periderm. Comparative analysis with protoplast-derived transcriptome data reveals significant biases, with nuclei-based sequencing providing a higher representation of cells in lignified inner xylem tissues. Among previously underrepresented types, we uncover vessel-associated cells (VAC), a largely uncharacterized parenchyma subtype and the terminus of a xylem cell lineage. Gene regulatory analysis identifies a VAC-specific network and the Populus MYB48 as its primary regulator. Functional validation of MYB48 knockout mutants show an increase in vessel number and size, pointing to a role of VACs in vessel development. Our study demonstrates the capture and transcriptome characterization of cell types embedded in plant secondary growth, identifying novel regulators of xylem development and stress adaptation. The discovery of MYB48 as a key regulator of VAC function highlights a previously uncharacterized mechanism influencing vessel development, with applications to improving wood formation and stress resilience.","Schmidt, Henry W; Conde, Daniel; Pereira, Wendell J; Triozzi, Paolo M; Balmant, Kelly M; Dervinis, Christopher; Kirst, Matias","Centro de Biotecnologıa y Genomica de Plantas, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid-Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnologıa Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA-CSIC), Madrid, 28223, Spain.; School of Forest, Fisheries and Geomatics Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Horticultural Sciences Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611, USA. mkirst@ufl.edu.; Institute of Plant Sciences, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, 56010, Italy.; Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.; Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. mkirst@ufl.edu.",Genome biology,Genome Biol,"Populus, Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell Nucleus, Plant Stems, Xylem, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Single-Cell Analysis, Gene Expression Profiling, Transcriptome, Phloem",2025,08,28,2025,09,01,"DE-SC0023082_NONE_US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40877938,10.1186/s13059-025-03728-x,,,,
40866974,PGIP: a web server for the rapid taxonomic identification of parasite genomes.,"Parasitic diseases remain a global health challenge, and traditional methods in their diagnosis face limitations in sensitivity and scalability. Genome-based sequencing technologies have improved and are increasingly employed for the identification of parasites; however, their clinical adoption remains hindered by the complexity of bioinformatics analysis, reliance on incomplete reference databases, and accessibility barriers for nonspecialists. Overcoming these challenges necessitates the development of standardized analytical workflows and high-quality genomic resources specifically tailored for parasite identification. We developed a user-friendly web server named the Parasite Genome Identification Platform (PGIP). The reference database was sourced from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), WormBase, European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and VEuPathDB, rigorously filtered for quality, and deduplicated using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) to ensure accuracy and nonredundancy. To streamline analysis, we integrated a standardized identification pipeline built on Nextflow, which encompasses host DNA depletion, quality control, parasite species identification via both reads mapping and assembly-based approaches, and automated report generation for comprehensive diagnostic insights. PGIP integrates a curated database of 280 parasite genomes; which is rigorously filtered for quality and taxonomic accuracy. Validation across diverse datasets demonstrated the precise species-level resolution of PGIP, and its compatibility with clinical samples. The platform features an intuitive graphic interface; and one-click analysis significantly reduces reliance on bioinformatics expertise, thus enabling rapid diagnosis. PGIP offers an accurate, efficient, and a user-friendly web server designed to simplify and accelerate the taxonomic identification of parasite genomes using data from metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Its automated framework reduces the need for specialized expertise, enabling rapid application in clinical and public health settings.","Zhang, Jiayao; Tang, Feng; Ni, Bixian; Zhang, Qiang; Gong, Xinyi; Mao, Fanzhen; Cao, Jun; Liu, Yaobao","School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, Jiangsu, China. caojuncn@hotmail.com.; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Laboratory, Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Wuxi, 214064, Jiangsu, China. caojuncn@hotmail.com.; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Laboratory, Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Wuxi, 214064, Jiangsu, China. yaobao0721@163.com.; School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, Jiangsu, China. yaobao0721@163.com.; National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Jiangsu Provincial Medical Key Laboratory, Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Wuxi, 214064, Jiangsu, China.",Parasites & vectors,Parasit Vectors,"Internet, Animals, Parasites, Computational Biology, Software, Databases, Genetic, Genomics, Parasitic Diseases",2025,08,28,2025,08,30,"ZDXYS202207_NONE_Jiangsu Province Capability Improvement Project through Science, Technology, and Education_; 2020YFC1200100_NONE_National Key R&D Program of China_; 82372275_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40866974,10.1186/s13071-025-07007-3,40866974,0,0,NONE
40826123,Improving automated deep phenotyping through large language models using retrieval-augmented generation.,"Diagnosing rare genetic disorders relies on precise phenotypic and genotypic analysis, with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) providing a standardized language for capturing clinical phenotypes. Rule-based HPO extraction tools use concept recognition to automatically identify phenotypes, but they often struggle with incomplete phenotype assignment, requiring significant manual review. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for more context-driven phenotype extraction, they are prone to errors and ""hallucinations,"" making them less reliable without further refinement. We present RAG-HPO, a Python-based tool that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to elevate accuracy of HPO term assignment by LLM. This approach bypasses the limitations of baseline models and eliminates the need for time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning. RAG-HPO integrates a dynamic vector database, containing > 54,000 phenotypic phrases mapped to HPO IDs, which allows real-time retrieval and contextual matching. The RAG-HPO workflow begins by extracting phenotypic phrases from clinical text via an LLM and then matching them via semantic similarity to entries within the database. The best term matches are returned to the LLM as context for final HPO term assignment of each phrase. Performance was benchmarked on 112 published case reports with 1792 manually assigned HPO terms and compared to Doc2HPO, ClinPhen, and FastHPOCR. In evaluations, RAG-HPO + LLaMa-3.1 70B achieved a mean precision of 0.81, recall of 0.76, and an F1 score of 0.78-significantly surpassing conventional tools (p < 0.00001). RAG-HPO returned 1648 terms, of which 19.1% (315) were false positives that did not exactly match our manually annotated standard. Among these, < 1% (1/315) represented hallucinations, and 1.3% (4/315) represented terms with no ontological relationship to the desired target; the remaining false positives (95.2%, 300/315) were broader ancestor terms of the target term, which may still be relevant to users in many contexts. RAG-HPO is a user-friendly, adaptable tool designed for secure evaluation of clinical text and outperforms standard HPO-matching tools in precision, recall, and F1. Its enhanced precision and recall represent a substantial advancement in phenotypic analysis, accelerating the identification of genetic mechanisms underlying rare diseases and driving progress in genetic research and clinical genomics.

40836244,Phenotypic characterization and complete genome of a tumorigenic pathobiont Escherichia coli LI60C3.,"Symbiotic microbes benefit the host, but the emergence of pathobionts leads to disease. An invasive Escherichia coli LI60C3, isolated from mouse colonocytes, shows colitogenic and tumorigenic properties. Despite extensive research on the role of microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC) development, the genetic markers associated with this pathobiont remain elusive. The objective is to characterize the tumorigenic E. coli through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic assays, and validate their presence in human CRC. The intracellular bacterial counts and proliferation rates of human intestinal epithelial cells were evaluated after exposure to various E. coli strains. Tumor burden was assessed in mice orally administered LI60C3. WGS of LI60C3 was performed on a PacBio Sequel II platform, and the long reads were assembled de novo for gene annotation and detection of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Bacteria-specific genes were assessed in CRC specimens by qPCR analysis. A 100-fold increase in intracellular bacterial count was observed in epithelial cells exposed to LI60C3 compared to commensal E. coli strains. LI60C3 resulted in a threefold increase in epithelial cell cycle rate and a fourfold rise in mouse tumor numbers. WGS revealed a circular chromosome of 4,863,930 bases for LI60C3, demonstrating a high sequence homology to adherent-invasive E. coli LF82 (91%) and NC101 (87%) and to uropathogenic E. coli 536 (88%). Two extrachromosomal plasmids, pTra and pCoMb, were identified. While pTra exhibits sequence homology with other commensal E. coli plasmids, pCoMb has partial matches with those found in pathogenic bacteria. LI60C3 is classified as phylogroup B2 and expresses virulence factors, including Type 1 and P fimbriae, contact-dependent growth inhibition system, iron acquisition system, and hemolysin. Unique gene clusters, named Epm and Phz islands, were identified in the LI60C3 genome. The emergence of LI60C3-specific genes was observed in mouse tumors induced by chemicals and gene mutation, and higher levels of LI60C3 markers were validated in human CRC specimens compared with healthy mucosal samples. Genetic signatures of LI60C3 were detected in mouse and human CRC. The comparative genome analysis for LI60C3 helps identify pathobionts and may be used as cancer predictors.","Yu, Linda Chia-Hui; Wei, Shu-Chen; Li, Yi-Hsuan; Huang, Chung-Yen; Pai, Yu-Chen; Hung, Yuan-Mao; Lai, Liang-Chuan; Ni, Yen-Hsuan","Department of Pathology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core, Center of Genomic and Precision Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.. yhni@ntu.edu.tw.; Graduate Institute of Physiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.; Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.",Gut pathogens,Gut Pathog,,2025,08,20,2025,09,14,"NHRI-EX111/112/113-11108BI_NONE_National Health Research Institute, Taiwan_; NSTC 113-2320-B002-062-MY3, MoST 110-2320-B-002-011-MY3_NONE_National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836244,10.1186/s13099-025-00732-1,40836244,0,0,NONE

40813941,Computed tomography radiomics to predict microsatellite instability status and immunotherapy response in gastric cancer.,"To develop and validate a CT radiomics model for predicting microsatellite instability (MSI) status in preoperative gastric cancer (GC) patients and to explore the underlying immune infiltration pattern of the radiomics model. This study used three retrospective datasets from Tongji Hospital (n = 304, training set), Xiangyang Central Hospital (n = 48, external testing set 1) and public datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) (n = 43, external testing set 2). The preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images of GC were evaluated. Radiomics features were extracted and selected to construct the radiomics model in the training set, and further validated in the other two external testing sets. The outcome cohort, including 68 advanced unresectable GC patients receiving immunotherapy, was used to assess the predictive value of the radiomics model for treatment response and outcomes. We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from TCIA to investigate the underlying genomics characterization and immune infiltration spectrum of the radiomics model. Four radiomic features were ultimately selected to develop the radiomics model. The model demonstrated good predictive performance for MSI status, achieving AUCs of 0.952, 0.835, and 0.879 in the training set and the two external testing sets, respectively. Radiomics scores (Radscores) was an independent predictor for PFS in the outcome cohort (HR: 0.145; 95% CI: 0.032-0.657; p = 0.012). Radscores were positively correlated with CD8+ T cells (R = 0.74, p = 0.013) and negatively related to M2-type macrophages (R = -0.67, p = 0.028). Our CT radiomics model could effectively predict MSI status and immunotherapy outcomes in GC patients therefore, may act as a potential noninvasive tool for personalized treatment decisions. Our study develops a noninvasive biomarker based on readily available imaging to identify gastric cancer patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. It also reveals biological meanings of the radiomics biomarker, promoting further research into interpretability and clinical application of radiomics. A CT-based radiomics model was constructed to noninvasively predict gastric cancer (GC) microsatellite instability status. This immune-related radiomics model can effectively predict immunotherapy outcomes in GC. This noninvasive method can serve as a supplement for treatment decisions.","Li, Zhou; Ding, Zixuan; Lian, Yongping; Liu, Yongqing; Wang, Lei; Hu, Pengbo; Zhang, Fangyuan; Luo, Yan; Qiu, Hong","Lanzhou University School of Medicine, Lanzhou, China.; Xiangyang Central Hospital, Xiangyang, China.; Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. qiuhong@hust.edu.cn.; Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. yanluo@hust.edu.cn.",Insights into imaging,Insights Imaging,,2025,08,14,2025,09,14,82008716_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 82373056_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40813941,10.1186/s13244-025-02050-1,40813941,0,,
40883856,"The first complete mitochondrial genome of Zu cristatus (Bonelli, 1819) sheds new light on its phylogenetic position and molecular evolution.","Fishes are key components of the megafauna of the deep sea, and evolutionary adaptations to deep-sea life appear to have occurred independently in at least 22 fish orders. In this context, the analysis of even more fish genomes and mitogenomes has fundamental importance, providing a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation, especially to extreme environments such as the deep sea. Here, we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of Zu cristatus (Bonelli, 1819), providing essential information on its structure and phylogeny. After sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, processing, and assembly via MitoFinder software v.1.4.1, a single circular mtDNA molecule of 17,450 bp in length was annotated. A total of 37 genes were identified, including the first D-loop region for this species. The asymmetry for both AT skews and GC skews is negative, and the AT content is 56.4%. We also detected the presence of 15 small, noncoding, intergenic nucleotide (IGN) regions and some rare stop codons in bony fishes. Pairwise distance and phylogenetic analyses against a list of other mitochondrial sequences from 42 bony fishes confirmed the current phylogeny with previously related orders. EasycodeML analysis revealed that only 4 PCGs underwent positive selection. New questions about the phylogeny of Lampriformes emerged from our phylogenetic analyses of Lampriformes COI. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the need to elucidate the genetic features of bony fishes in relation to their deep-sea adaptation, with a focus on rare and interesting species.","Albano, Marco; Giosa, Domenico; de Oliveira Fernandes, Jorge Manuel; Savoca, Serena; Bonomo, Andrea; Giuffrè, Letterio; Tripathy, Partha Sarathi; Romeo, Orazio; Spanò, Nunziacarla; Capillo, Gioele","Faculty of Biosciences and Aquaculture, Nord University, Bodø, 8026, Norway.; Sea in Health and Life Srl, c/o Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Capo Peloro, Messina, 98164, Italy. serena.savoca@unime.it.; Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, 98166, Italy. serena.savoca@unime.it.; Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, 98168, Italy.; College of Fisheries, Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India.; Institute of Marine Sciences, Spanish National Research Council, Barcelona, 08003, Spain.; Sea in Health and Life Srl, c/o Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Capo Peloro, Messina, 98164, Italy.; Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, 98166, Italy.",BMC zoology,BMC Zool,,2025,08,29,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883856,10.1186/s40850-025-00238-y,40883856,0,0,NONE
40903764,Convergent domestication of bitter apples and pears by selecting mutations of MYB transcription factors to reduce proanthocyanidin levels.,"Fruit domestication has long aimed to reduce bitterness, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this trait remain only partially understood. Wild apples and pears naturally accumulate high levels of bitter proanthocyanidins (PAs), also known as condensed tannins. In this study, a convergent domestication process was identified in both fruits, involving the selection of weak alleles of MYB transcription factors that regulate PA biosynthesis. In apples, domestication targeted the MYB-Tannin-Tamer (MdMYBTT) gene. A 411-base pair transposable element inserted into the third exon of this gene in cultivated varieties produced a truncated, non-functional protein unable to activate the PA biosynthetic gene Anthocyanidin Reductase 1 (ANR1). The resulting mdmybtt allele led to reduced PA levels and was fixed in domesticated apples through positive selection. Likewise, in pears, a 57-base pair insertion in the promoter of the MYBPA1 gene suppressed its expression in cultivated varieties, limiting PA production.

40893137,BAYESIAN DIFFERENTIAL CAUSAL DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS FOR OBSERVATIONAL ZERO-INFLATED COUNTS WITH AN APPLICATION TO TWO-SAMPLE SINGLE-CELL DATA.,"Observational zero-inflated count data arise in a wide range of areas such as genomics. One of the common research questions is to identify causal relationships by learning the structure of a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG). While structure learning of DAGs has been an active research area, existing methods do not adequately account for excessive zeros and therefore are not suitable for modeling zero-inflated count data. Moreover, it is often interesting to study differences in the causal networks for data collected from two experimental groups (control vs treatment). To explicitly account for zero-inflation and identify differential causal networks, we propose a novel Bayesian differential zero-inflated negative binomial DAG (DAG0) model. We prove that the causal relationships under the proposed DAG0 are fully identifiable from purely observational, cross-sectional data, using a general proof technique that is applicable beyond the proposed model. Bayesian inference based on parallel-tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo is developed to efficiently explore the multi-modal posterior landscape. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed DAG0 by comparing it with state-of-the-art alternative methods through extensive simulations. An application in a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset generated under two experimental groups finds some interesting results that appear to be consistent with existing knowledge. A user-friendly R package that implements DAG0 is available at https://github.com/junsoukchoi/BayesDAG0.git.","Choi, Junsouk; Chapkin, Robert S; Ni, Yang","Department of Statistics and Data Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin.; Department of Nutrition, Texas A&M University.; Department of Statistics, Korea University.",The annals of applied statistics,Ann Appl Stat,,2025,08,28,2025,09,05,R01 GM148974_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40893137,10.1214/25-aoas2042,40893137,0,0,NONE
40896502,Chromosome-level assembly of <i>Cucumis sativus</i> cv. 'Tokiwa' as a reference genome of Japanese cucumber.,"Cucumber is one of the most important vegetables in the Japanese market. To facilitate genomics-based breeding, there is a demand for reference genome of Japanese cucumber. However, although cucumber genome is relatively small, its assembly is a challenging issue because of tandem repeats comprising ~30% (~100 Mbp) of the genome. To overcome, we deployed the Oxford Nanopore sequencing that produces long reads with N50 length of >30 kbp. With this technology we achieved a chromosome-level assembly of cv. 'Tokiwa', a founder line of Japanese cucumber represented with the elongated fruit shape and high-crisp texture. Compared to the existing cucumber genomes, the Tokiwa genome is 20% longer and annotated with 10% more genes. The assembly with nanopore long reads also resolved tandem repeats spanning >100 kbp, demonstrating its strength in overcoming repetitive sequences.","Seiko, Takashi; Muto, Chiaki; Shimomura, Koichiro; Yano, Ryoichi; Kawazu, Yoichi; Sugiyama, Mitsuhiro; Kato, Kenji; Tomooka, Norihiko; Naito, Ken","Research Center of Genetic Resources, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.; Research Center of Advanced Analysis, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.; Institute of Vegetable and Floriculture Science, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 360 Kusawa, Ano, Tsu, Mie 514-2392, Japan.; Graduate School of Environment, Life, Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, 1-1-1 Tsushimanaka, Kita, Okayama, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.",Breeding science,Breed Sci,,2025,03,27,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40896502,10.1270/jsbbs.24066,40896502,0,0,NONE
40797952,Color-corrected and high-contrast catadioptric relay for maskless high-resolution nucleic acid photolithography.,"Large-scale synthesis of DNA and RNA is a crucial technology for modern biological research ranging from genomics to nucleic acid therapeutics and for technological research ranging from nanofabrication of materials to molecular-level writing of digital data. Maskless array synthesis (MAS) is a versatile and efficient approach for creating the required complex microarrays and libraries of DNA and other nucleic acids for these applications and, more generally, for synthesizing sequence-defined engineered and biological oligomers. MAS uses digital photomasks displayed by a digital micromirror device (DMD) illuminated by an appropriate light source and imaged into a photochemical reaction chamber with an optical relay system. Previously, Offner relay systems were used for imaging, but modern DMD formats with more and smaller micromirrors favor a different solution. We present a desktop MAS optical system with the larger numerical aperture and larger field of view required by 1080p and other large-format DMDs. The resulting catadioptric relay is well suited to modern DMDs in this application and is corrected for first-order axial and lateral color, enabling the use of high-power LEDs as inexpensive and long-lasting light sources spanning the ultraviolet-to-violet to perform the required photochemistry. Additional system characteristics, including high contrast and low scatter, make it ideal for reducing the error rates in the photochemical synthesis of biomolecules.","Michel, Timm; Behr, Jürgen; Sabzalipoor, Hamed; Ibáñez-Redín, Gisela; Lietard, Jory; Schletterer, Thomas; Funck, Max; Somoza, Mark M",,Optics express,Opt Express,"Equipment Design, DNA, Color, Nucleic Acids, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis",2025,08,13,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40797952,10.1364/OE.557937,40797952,0,,

We found P. hessleri accumulates exceptionally high level of toxic element arsenic (>1% of wet weight) and tolerated elevated concentrations hydrogen sulphide. Using advanced microscopy, elementary analysis, and genomics and proteomics approaches, we identified a previously unrecognized arsenic-sulfide biomineralization process in P. hessleri. Our data suggest that arsenic accumulates within epithelial cell granules, where it likely reacts with sulphide diffused inward from the hydrothermal vent fluid, resulting in the intracellular formation of orpiment (As₂S₃) minerals. In this ""fighting poison with poison"" manner, the highly toxic arsenic and sulphide were simultaneously detoxified in the form of orpiment minerals within the intracellular granules of the single layer of epithelial cells. This process represents a remarkable adaptation to extreme chemical environments. Our study provides new insights into understanding animals' environment adaptation mechanisms and the diversity and plasticity of biomineralization.","Wang, Hao; Cao, Lei; Zhang, Huan; Zhong, Zhaoshan; Zhou, Li; Lian, Chao; Wang, Xiaocheng; Chen, Hao; Wang, Minxiao; Zhang, Xin; Li, Chaolun","Laboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao Marine Science and Technology Centre, Laoshan Laboratory, Qingdao, China.; Key Laboratory of Marine Geology and Environment, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, P.

40875616,Alterations in ether lipid metabolism in obesity revealed by systems genomics of multi-omics datasets.,"Ratios between two metabolites are sensitive indicators of metabolic changes. Lipidomic profiling studies have revealed that plasma ether lipids, a class of glycero- and glycerophospho-lipids with reported health benefits, are negatively associated with obesity. Here, we utilized lipid ratios as surrogate markers of lipid metabolism to explore the processes underlying the inverse relationship between ether lipid metabolism and obesity. Plasma lipidomics data from two independent human cohorts (n = 10,339 and n = 4,492) were integrated to assess the associations between 82 lipid ratios and obesity-related markers in males and females. Results were externally validated using mouse transcriptomics data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (n = 152-227 across 74 strains). Genome-wide association studies using imputed genotypes from a population cohort (n = 4,492) were performed to examine the genetic architecture of the ratios. Findings showed that waist circumference (WC), body mass index, and waist-hip ratio were inversely associated with total plasmalogens relative to total phospholipids in both sexes. Ratios comprising product-substrate pairs positioned either side of enzymes involved in plasmalogen synthesis and degradation showed positive and negative associations with WC, respectively. Branched-chain fatty acids negatively correlated with WC, while omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited differing associations depending on their position within the pathway. Mouse transcriptomics corroborated these results. Genomics data showed strong associations between ratios containing choline-plasmalogens and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transmembrane protein 229B (TMEM229B) gene region. This work demonstrates the utility of lipid ratios in understanding lipid metabolism. By applying the ratios to multi-omic datasets, we identified alterations in enzymatic activity and genetic variants likely affecting ether lipid synthesis in obesity that could not have been obtained from lipidomics data alone. Additionally, we characterized a potential role for TMEM229B, offering new perspectives on ether lipid metabolism and regulation.","Schooneveldt, Yvette L; Paul, Sudip; Huynh, Kevin; Beyene, Habtamu B; Mellett, Nat A; Watts, Gerald F; Hung, Joseph; Hui, Jennie; Beilby, John; Blangero, John; Moses, Eric K; Shaw, Jonathan E; Magliano, Dianna J; Seldin, Marcus M; Drew, Brian G; Calkin, Anna C; Giles, Corey; Meikle, Peter J","Baker Department of Cardiovascular Research Translation and Implementation, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.; School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.; School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.; School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.; School of Population and Global Health, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.; Department of Biological Chemistry Centre for Epigenetics and Metabolism, University of California, Irvine, California, United States of America.; South Texas Diabetes and Obesity Institute, The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Brownsville, Texas, United States of America.; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, Nursing & Health Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Lipid Disorders Clinic, Department of Cardiology, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia.",PLoS biology,PLoS Biol,"Humans, Male, Female, Lipid Metabolism, Animals, Obesity, Mice, Lipidomics, Genomics, Genome-Wide Association Study, Body Mass Index, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Plasmalogens, Waist Circumference, Adult, Multiomics",2025,08,28,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40875616,10.1371/journal.pbio.3003349,,,,

Leveraging microbiomes to promote soil health and plant growth requires understanding underlying molecular mechanisms using reproducible experimental systems. In a global collaborative effort involving five laboratories, we aimed to help advance reproducibility in microbiome studies by testing our ability to replicate synthetic community assembly experiments. Our study compared fabricated ecosystems constructed using two different synthetic bacterial communities, the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, and sterile EcoFAB 2.0 devices. All participating laboratories observed consistent inoculum-dependent changes in plant phenotype, root exudate composition, and final bacterial community structure, where Paraburkholderia sp. OAS925 could dramatically shift microbiome composition. Comparative genomics and exudate utilization linked the pH-dependent colonization ability of Paraburkholderia, which was further confirmed with motility assays.

40839700,NextVir: Enabling classification of tumor-causing viruses with genomic foundation models.,"Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative-instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required. We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models-DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA-and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads' origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.","Robertson, John; Consul, Shorya; Vikalo, Haris","Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America.",PLoS computational biology,PLoS Comput Biol,"Humans, Genomics, Computational Biology, Genome, Viral, Oncogenic Viruses, Neoplasms, DNA, Viral, Sequence Analysis, DNA, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing",2025,08,21,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40839700,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013360,40839700,0,0,NONE
40911641,"Charting the equine miRNA landscape: An integrated pipeline and browser for annotating, quantifying, and visualizing expression.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression, yet few comprehensive databases exist for miRNA expression in non-model species, limiting our ability to characterize their roles in gene regulation, development, and disease. Similarly, isomiRs - length and sequence isoforms of canonical miRNAs with potentially altered regulatory targets and functions - have received even less attention in non-model species, including the horse, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of their biological significance. To address these challenges, we developed an open-source, containerized pipeline for identifying and quantifying miRNAs and isomiRs (FARmiR: Framework for Analysis and Refinement of miRNAs), and an associated interactive browser (AIMEE: Animal IsomiR and MiRNA Expression Explorer). AIMEE was developed to make miRNA expression data more accessible and user-friendly, a feature often lacking from other expression atlases. These tools were developed using equine data but can be readily extended to other species. Using these tools, we aggregated 461 small RNA-seq datasets, spanning 61 distinct tissues, integrating data from public repositories, an American Quarter Horse cohort, and the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genome (FAANG) consortium Thoroughbred samples, predicting 5,781 miRNAs and isomiRs. This work represents the largest systematically curated atlas of equine miRNA expression to date, providing a valuable resource that will enhance our understanding of miRNA and isomiR functions in tissue-specific regulation and ultimately improve biomarker discovery, functional genomics, and precision veterinary medicine.","Cullen, Jonah N; Cieslak, Jakub; Petersen, Jessica L; Bellone, Rebecca R; Finno, Carrie J; Kalbfleisch, Ted S; Calloe, Kirstine; Capomaccio, Stefano; Cappelli, Katia; Coleman, Stephen J; Distl, Ottmar; Durward-Akhurst, Sian A; Giulotto, Elena; Hamilton, Natasha A; Hill, Emmeline W; Katz, Lisa M; Klaerke, Dan A; Lindgren, Gabriella; MacHugh, David E; Mackowski, Mariusz; MacLeod, James N; Metzger, Julia; Murphy, Barbara A; Orlando, Ludovic; Raudsepp, Terje; Silvestrelli, Maurizio; Strand, Eric; Tozaki, Teruaki; Trachsel, Dagmar S; Valderrama Figueroa, Laura S; Velie, Brandon D; Wade, Claire M; Waud, Bianca; Mickelson, James R; McCue, Molly E","Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Aas, Norway.; Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.; Department of Veterinary Science, Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.; Institute of Animal Genomics, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.; UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.; Equine Genetics & Genomics Group, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States of America.; Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.; Department of Genetics and Animal Breeding, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poznan, Poland.; Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, United States of America.; UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.; College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, United States of America.; School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.; Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California - Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.; Genetic Analysis Department, Laboratory of Racing Chemistry, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan.; Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse, CNRS, Université de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.; Department of Veterinary Science, Gluck Equine Research Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America.; Sport Horse Research Centre, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; UCD Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland.; Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.; Equine Genetics Research Centre, Racing Australia, Scone, New South Wales, Australia.; Sydney School of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California - Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.; Department of Animal Biosciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.; Department of Biosystems, Center for Animal Breeding and Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Veterinary Population Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.",PLoS genetics,PLoS Genet,,2025,09,05,2025,09,05,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40911641,10.1371/journal.pgen.1011835,40911641,0,0,NONE
40788925,Population genomics of Aedes albopictus across remote Pacific islands for genetic biocontrol considerations.,"Remote Pacific islands (RPI) are characterized by ecological isolation, diverse endemic species, and vulnerability to invasive organisms due to globalization-driven connectivity. Among these species, Aedes albopictus, a highly invasive vector of flaviviruses, has spread extensively across the RPI via human-mediated dispersal, posing significant health and economic burdens. While the population structure and the degree of gene flow between mosquito populations can inform the dispersal pathways critical for disease vector management, the population genetics of Ae. albopictus in Northern RPI remains understudied. The present work investigated the population structure and connectivity of Ae. albopictus populations from Guam, Hawaiian Islands, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) to inform disease and vector-based biosecurity risks and develop targeted management strategies. This is the first assessment to develop and analyze whole genome sequences of Ae. albopictus for RPI, enabling more accurate estimates of differentiation, admixture, and ancestry. We found distinct genetic clustering between regions, distinct ancestry of populations across RPI, and potential invasions that originated from Hawaii and spread into the RMI, and invasions from North America that spread to Guam. These findings can inform biosecurity protocols to limit the invasion of Ae. albopictus and their associated diseases within Hawaii and around the Pacific. Given the significant degree of genetic differentiation, we found between islets, islands, and regions, the genome data from this study can be used to enable the development of locally confined geographically isolated gene drives. These drives may be used to prevent and control outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, diseases that have had devastating consequences in these remote island communities.","Seok, Sangwoo; Vorsino, Adam E; Collier, Travis C; Hapairai, Limb K; Jacobsen, Christopher M; Hasty, Jeomhee M; Romero-Weaver, Ana L; Buckner, Eva A; LaPointe, Dennis A; Leong, Mark K H; Braack, Leo; Tabuloc, Christine A; Chiu, Joanna C; Raban, Robyn; Akbari, Omar S; Lee, Yoosook","Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, Department of Entomology and Nematology, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Vero Beach, Florida, United States of America.; Independent Researcher, Vero Beach, Florida, United States of America.; United States of America Geological Survey, Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.; Vector Control Branch, Hawaii State Department of Health, Hilo, Hawaii, United States of America.; Strategic Habitat Conservation Program, Ecological Services, Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office, United States of America Fish and Wildlife Service, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.; Environmental Health, Department of Public Health, Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.; Pacific Island Health Officers' Association, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America.; Department of Entomology and Nematology, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Davis, California, United States of America.; School of Biological Sciences, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, San Diego, California, United States of America.; Malaria Consortium, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Animals, Aedes, Pacific Islands, Mosquito Vectors, Genetics, Population, Humans, Gene Flow, Genome, Insect, Genomics",2025,08,11,2025,08,26,U01 CK000516_CK_NCEZID CDC HHS_United States; R35 GM156217_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI151004_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40788925,10.1371/journal.pntd.0013414,40788925,0,,
40839583,Harnessing subtractive genomics for drug target identification in Streptococcus agalactiae serotype v (atcc baa-611 / 2603 v/r) strain: An in-silico approach.,"Developing a therapeutic target for bacterial disease is challenging. In silico subtractive genomics methodology offer a promising alternative to traditional drug discovery methods. Streptococcus agalactiae infections depend on two crucial criteria: drug-resistance and the existence of virulence factors. It is essential to underline that S. agalactiae strains have emerged to be resistant to several drugs. Hence, there is a need for research on novel drugs and techniques that are potent, economical, productive, and dependable to combat S. agalactiae infections. In this study advanced computational techniques were exploited to examine potential druggable targets exclusive to this pathogen. Our study uncovered 200 non-homologous proteins in S. agalactiae serotype V (Strain ATCC BAA-611/ 2603 V/R) and identified 68 essential proteins indispensable for the bacterium's survival. Therefore, these 68 proteins are potential targets for drug development. Subcellular localization analysis unveiled that the pathogen's cytoplasmic membrane contained essential proteins among these vital non-homologous proteins. On the other hand, based on virulent protein predictions, six proteins were seen to be virulent. Among these, we prioritized two proteins (Sensor protein LytS and Galactosyl transferase CpsE which are exclusively found in S. agalactiae) as potential druggable targets and selected them for further structural investigation. The proteins chosen could serve as a foundation for the identification of a promising therapeutic compound that has the potential to neutralize these enzymatic proteins, thereby contributing to the reduction of risks linked to the drug-resistant S. agalactiae.","Chowdhury, Ashiqur Rahman Khan; Tithi, Farjana Yasmin; Bhuiyan, Nusrat Zahan; Ishita, Afsana Ferdousi; Sohel, Md Mahmodul Hasan","Department of Life Sciences, School of Environment and Life Sciences, Independent University, Bangladesh.",PloS one,PLoS One,"Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacterial Proteins, Genomics, Computer Simulation, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Streptococcal Infections, Virulence Factors, Serogroup, Genome, Bacterial, Humans",2025,08,21,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40839583,10.1371/journal.pone.0319368,40839583,0,0,NONE
40824962,The role of SLC2A1 in lung adenocarcinoma: From tumorigenesis to patient survival.,"Our study aimed at systematically exploring the effect of the solute carrier family 2 Member (SLC2A) genes family on the prognosis and immune landscape of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Furthermore, we sought to determine the SLC2A1 function in LUAD initiation and progression through in vivo and in vitro experiments. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was conducted utilizing online tools and software, including R packages, Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA), cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal), GeneMANIA, STRING, and Xiantao Academic Online databases, to assess the functional implications of the SLC2A gene family in LUAD. Concurrently, in vivo and in vitro experiments at the cellular and animal levels were conducted to ascertain the effects of SLC2A1 gene knockout on LUAD development. Compared to normal tissues, the SLC2A gene family exhibited significant upregulation across various tumor types, including LUAD, with a low mutation frequency in LUAD. SLC2A1 and SLC2A7 emerged as prognostic biomarkers for LUAD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed high diagnostic accuracy of SLC2A1 for LUAD. A significant negative correlation was observed between SLC2A1 expression and DNA methylation levels in LUAD, and the gene was closely linked to cellular processes such as cell nuclear division, DNA replication, and metabolism. Moreover, SLC2A1 expression was strongly linked to immune infiltration and regulation across different tumor types.

40824894,Deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease detection using magnetic resonance imaging and gene expression data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to healthcare systems across the globe. Early and accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genomics provide an opportunity for developing multi-modality-based AD diagnosis models using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, the data complexities cause challenges in developing interpretable AI-based AD identification models. In this study, the author built a comprehensive AD diagnostic model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gene expression data. MobileNet V3 and EfficientNet B7 model was employed to extract AD features from gene expression data. The author introduced a hybrid TWIN-Performer-based feature extraction model to derive features from MRI. The attention-based feature fusion was used to fuse the crucial features. An ensemble learning-based classification model integrating CatBoost, XGBoost, and extremely randomized tree (ERT) was developed to identify cognitively normal (CN) and AD features. The proposed model was validated on diverse datasets. It achieved a superior performance on MRI and gene expression datasets. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores were consistently above 0.85, indicating excellent model performance. The use of Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values improved the model's interpretability, leading to earlier interventions and personalized treatment strategies.","Almarri, Badar","Department of Computer Science, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.",PloS one,PLoS One,"Alzheimer Disease, Humans, Deep Learning, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Gene Expression Profiling, ROC Curve, Male",2025,08,18,2025,09,18,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40824894,10.1371/journal.pone.0330085,40824894,0,,
40853988,Gap-free comparative genomics uncover virulence factors for Fusarium wilt of watermelons.,"Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) is a globally important fruit crop, yet it is susceptible to devastating diseases such as vascular wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon), with limited control options. Fon rapidly evolves to overcome host resistance, constantly threatening production through new pathogenic races. High-quality genomic resources are key to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Fon virulence evolution for disease management. Here, we de novo assembled and annotated gapless genomes of three isolates affiliated with different physiological races of Fon (race 1, 2, and 3), and dissected the mechanisms behind their distinctive virulence through comparative genomics and transcriptomics. Core and accessory chromosomes in Fon were identified, where each race-affiliated isolate carried a unique set of accessory chromosomes or regions. Comparative transcriptomics of Fon infection revealed distinctive temporal patterns of gene expression even among core gene families, particularly those related to cell wall degradation enzymes. Effectoromic prediction and comparative analysis in three gap-free genomes identified 13 FonR3-specific effectors (FonR3SEs), one (FonR3SE1) of which was a critical virulence factor of FonR3 on watermelon as demonstrated via functional experiments. These gap-free genome assemblies and FonR3SEs provide valuable resources for studying Fon pathobiology and evolution and improving development of disease control strategies.","Ayhan, Dilay Hazal; Wang, Huan; Zhang, Lili; Wang, Guan; Yi, Shu; Meng, Dian; Xue, Lifang; Geng, Xin; Kong, Zhijun; Wang, Xinrui; Wang, Lu; Yang, Qingxian; Wang, Xiangfeng; Deng, Yun; Zhang, Xingping; Guo, Li","School of Agriculture, Ningxia University, Yinchuan, China.; Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Acıbadem University, Istanbul, Türkiye.; Shandong Key Laboratory of Precision Molecular Crop Design and Breeding, Peking University Institute of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Shandong Laboratory of Advanced Agricultural Sciences in Weifang, Weifang, China.",PLoS pathogens,PLoS Pathog,"Fusarium, Virulence Factors, Citrullus, Plant Diseases, Genomics, Virulence, Genome, Fungal, Fungal Proteins",2025,08,25,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40853988,10.1371/journal.ppat.1013455,40853988,0,0,NONE
40916402,Intrapatient genomic divergence across multiple primary tumors in young Korean patients.,"Multiple primary tumors arising in the same individual pose challenges for precision oncology, particularly in the context of hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome. While these tumors may originate from a shared germline predisposition, it remains unclear whether they also share somatic alterations that could be therapeutically exploited. This study aimed to characterize the extent of somatic genomic overlap between synchronous or metachronous gastric and colorectal cancers within young Korean patients. Nineteen patients diagnosed with both gastric and colorectal cancers before age 55 underwent whole exome sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status was determined, and germline mismatch repair (MMR) variants were assessed to identify Lynch syndrome cases. Somatic mutations, mutational signatures, and copy number alterations were analyzed to quantify intertumoral genomic similarity within individual patients. Among the 37 tumors analyzed, 36.8% of gastric and 44.4% of colorectal cancers were MSI-high. Germline pathogenic MMR variants were identified in seven patients. Despite shared hypermutated phenotypes, the proportion of overlapping somatic mutations between paired tumors was consistently low (< 5%). Mutational signatures varied by MSI status and included SBS1/5 (aging) and SBS15 (MMR deficiency). Notably, one non-Lynch patient exhibited MYC amplification in both tumors, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Even in patients with shared germline predisposition, primary tumors arising in different organs demonstrate substantial genomic divergence. These findings suggest that organ-specific selective pressures drive independent tumor evolution, underscoring the need for individualized molecular profiling and therapeutic targeting in cases of multiple primary cancers.","Choi, Yoon Young","Department of Surgery, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Bucheon, Korea.",Korean journal of clinical oncology,Korean J Clin Oncol,,2025,08,31,2025,09,11,NONE_NONE_Soonchunhyang University_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40916402,10.14216/kjco.25359,40916402,0,0,NONE
40919714,Genomic Features of the methylosome protein MEP50 and its implication in Hormone Signaling and Cancer.,"Dysfunction of several WD40 family proteins causes diverse endocrine diseases. Until recently, MEP50, a WD40 protein, was considered a Gene of Unknown Significance (GUS) because no inherited diseases had been linked to its function. However, genetic inactivation of MEP50 in mouse models or somatic mutations in humans drive oncogenesis in several endocrine-related cancers, including those of the prostate, breast, and uterus. In this study, we generate new knowledge through a multi-tier integration of evolutionary genomics, sequence and structural analyses, molecular mechanics calculations, and dynamic simulations of wild-type and cancer-mutated MEP50 proteins. Indeed, we find that a conserved splicing event across evolution generates an alternative MEP50 isoform, which is smaller than the canonical MEP50 and lacks the final β-sheet of the first WD40 domain, the entirety of the second WD40 domain, and the first β-sheet of the third WD40 domain. Notably, we find that this novel, Short MEP50 (s-MEP50) transcript encodes a 278 amino acid protein that retains aspects of the key regulatory and interaction sites, including those critical for androgen receptor and PRMT5 binding. Finally, we analyze the mutational landscape of MEP50 in endocrine-regulated cancers and use molecular mechanics calculations and dynamic simulations to reveal that cancer-associated mutations disrupt conserved bonding networks and induce widespread structural destabilization within the WD40 domain architecture. Thus, by combining evolutionary, structural, and biophysical approaches, we advance the understanding of MEP50 genomics, providing significant mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into endocrine-regulated tissues and their cancers.","Pollin, Gareth; Chi, Young-In; Urrutia, Raul; Lomberk, Gwen",,Endocrine connections,Endocr Connect,,2025,09,08,2025,09,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40919714,10.1530/EC-25-0444,40919714,0,0,NONE
40828591,Elucidating the interplay between gut microbiota and autism spectrum disorder. New insights and therapeutic perspectives.,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a wide range of cognitive, behavioural and communication impairments. Children with autism have a distinctive and underdeveloped range and volume of gut bacteria (microbiome) which is often not related to their diet. Evidence gathered throughout years of research suggests that the pathway between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, referred to as the gut-brain axis (GBA), has a profound effect on the social behaviours of autistic children. The gut microbiome has been shown to play a vital role in the manifestation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms as gut dysbiosis - an imbalance in the gut microbiome - affects brain development through processes regulated by the neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and autonomic nervous systems. Although dysregulation of the gut microbiome and subsequent disruption of GBA are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism, the underlying mechanisms and the extent to which the microbiome contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders remain unclear. In this review, we focus on understanding the complex and multidirectional interplay between gut microbiota and ASD based on evidence mounted over the years. Furthermore, we examine how genomics, metabolomics and microbiome components can be integrated to unravel this multifactorial disorder. The ability to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ASD will pave the way for future advancements in therapy and treatment.","Mavridou, Maria; Kyriazidi, Maria Anna; Varlamis, Sotiris; Skepastianos, Petros; Mitka, Stella; Papaliagkas, Vasileios; Chatzidimitriou, Maria","2Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.; 1Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, International Hellenic University, 57400, Thessaloniki, Greece.",Acta microbiologica et immunologica Hungarica,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,,2025,08,19,2025,08,19,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40828591,10.1556/030.2025.02663,40828591,0,,

40827213,Isoform differences drive functional diversity of NHR-49.,"The <i>C. elegans</i> nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-49 , is a critical regulator of lipid metabolism, which possesses five isoforms differing predominantly within their N-termini. Yet functional distinctions between these different isoforms remain largely unexplored. Using CRISPR-based N- and C-terminal epitope tagging with the biotin ligase, TurboID, we observed that the longest isoform displays a more dynamic subcellular localization, partitioning between nucleus and cytoplasm. Proximity labeling revealed differences in interactomes with N-terminally tagged long isoform of NHR-49 enriched for cytoplasmic proteins, including endocytic machinery like RAB-10 and RAB-11.1 , while C-terminal tags associated primarily with inner nuclear pore components and transcriptional regulators. These findings highlight isoform-specific differences for NHR-49 which dramatically impact its subcellular localization and interaction networks. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized layer of regulatory complexity in nuclear receptor biology, which emphasize the importance of isoform preferences when interpreting functional genomics data in <i>C. elegans</i> and beyond.","Tatge, Lexus; Douglas, Peter M","Molecular Biology, Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, Dallas, Texas, United States.; Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States.",microPublication biology,MicroPubl Biol,,2025,08,01,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827213,10.17912/micropub.biology.001655,40827213,0,,

40792157,Integrative analysis of CRISPR screening and gene expression data identifies a three-gene prognostic model associated with immune microenvironment in neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous pediatric tumor with variable clinical outcomes. Current prognostic markers are insufficient to predict patient survival accurately, necessitating the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study aimed to develop a robust prognostic model by integrating CRISPR screening data and transcriptomic profiles, and to explore its correlation with the tumor immune microenvironment. We integrated Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) screening data from the DepMap database (version 24Q2) and gene expression profiles from neuroblastoma patients to identify key genes associated with neuroblastoma prognosis. Essential genes with Computational Evaluation of RNAi Essentiality Scores (CERES) scores less than -1 in at least 80% of 34 neuroblastoma cell lines were intersected with differentially expressed genes (|logFC| >2, P<0.05) from the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) dataset (accession code HRA002064), resulting in 43 overlapping genes. Random forest analysis and multivariate Cox regression were conducted on the GSE49710 training set (n=498) to construct a prognostic model. The model was externally validated using the E-MTAB-8248 dataset (n=223). Immune infiltration and immunotherapy response were assessed using Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data (ESTIMATE), Microenvironment Cell Populations counter (MCPcounter), Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT), immunophenoscore (IPS), and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithms. A three-gene prognostic model comprising <i>PKMYT1</i>, <i>CDT1</i>, and <i>NCAPG</i> was established. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the median RiskScore of 9.514526. In the training set, high-risk patients exhibited significantly poorer overall survival compared to low-risk patients (log-rank test, P<0.001). The model outperformed traditional clinical factors and demonstrated consistent prognostic value in the external validation cohort. High-risk patients showed lower immune cell infiltration, higher TIDE scores, and lower IPS values, suggesting an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced likelihood of responding to immunotherapy. In contrast, low-risk patients had higher immune infiltration and a predicted immunotherapy response rate of 70% versus 36% in the high-risk group. The three-gene prognostic model effectively stratifies neuroblastoma patients by survival risk and correlates with immune microenvironment characteristics. This model has potential clinical utility for prognosis prediction and guiding personalized immunotherapy strategies in neuroblastoma.","Li, Xin; Li, Wanrong; Wang, Jian","Department of Pathology, Tianjin Cancer Hospital Airport Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.; Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Cancer Hospital Airport Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.",Translational cancer research,Transl Cancer Res,,2025,07,14,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40792157,10.21037/tcr-2024-2472,40792157,0,,
40894066,Persistent Tic Disorders Are Associated With 17q12 Duplications.,"Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Persistent Tic Disorder (PTD) are childhood-onset neuropsychiatric conditions with high heritability. Due to current sample size limitations, identifying TS/PTD risk genes has been challenging. This study addressed this issue by conducting a meta-analysis of microarray copy number variant (CNV) studies from three TS/PTD genomics consortia, supplemented with new data from 3,291 cases. This approach more than doubled the sample size of previous TS/PTD CNV studies, with CNV calls generated from 5,725 TS/PTD cases and 10,982 matched controls. The results confirmed that TS/PTD cases 1) have a higher burden of ultra-rare deletions overlapping loss-of-function intolerant genes (OR = 1.68, P = 9.3×10^-5) and 2) are more likely to carry established neurodevelopmental CNVs (OR = 1.42, P = 3.9×10^-2) compared to controls. Additionally, a novel, genome-wide significant CNV locus for TS/PTD was discovered, involving duplications at 17q12 (hg19 chr17:34.8 - 36.2 Mb). This locus is associated with a known duplication syndrome associated with variable neuropsychiatric traits, but has not been previously linked to tic disorders. Eight cases and one control carried the canonical ~1.4 Mb duplication at chr17:34.8 - 36.2 Mb, while one additional case had a smaller 110 kb duplication within this known CNV that included only one gene, <i>ACACA</i> (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, OR = 26.7, P = 5.69×10^-7). Overall, this study provides further evidence that rare, genic CNVs play a substantial role in the genetic architecture of TS/PTD and identifies a new genome-wide significant association with this neurodevelopmental disorder.","Halvorsen, Matthew; Wang, Sheng; Miller-Fleming, Tyne; Yu, Dongmei; Topaloudi, Apostolia; de Schipper, Elles; Bäckman, Julia; Mataix-Cols, David; Rück, Christian; Mahjani, Behrang; Buxbaum, Joseph; Grice, Dorothy; Cavallari, Larisa; Angiolillo, Dominick; Franchi, Francesco; Davis, Lea; Han, Lide; Ruderfer, Douglas; Dietrich, Andrea; Hoekstra, Pieter; Mattheisen, Manuel; Porras, Luz; Giusti-Rodríguez, Paola; Mathews, Carol; Paschou, Peristera; Scharf, Jeremiah; Willsey, Jeremy; Crowley, James",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.; UNC Chapel Hill.; Mount Sinai School of Medicine.; Dalhousie University.; Karolinska Institutet.; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Massachusetts General Hospital.; University of Florida College of Medicine.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center.; Purdue University.,Research square,Res Sq,,2025,08,19,2025,09,15,R01 MH115963_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; P50 GM115305_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; U01 HG006378_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH096767_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH110427_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH115993_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH124679_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; R01 NS032830_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH115959_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; U01 NS040024_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH115960_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; U01 HG004798_HG_NHGRI NIH HHS_United States; S10 RR025141_RR_NCRR NIH HHS_United States; R01 NS040024_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; R01 HD074711_HD_NICHD NIH HHS_United States; RC2 GM092618_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; K02 NS085048_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH115958_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; U19 HL065962_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; R01 NS105746_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; UL1 TR000445_TR_NCATS NIH HHS_United States; R01 MH115961_MH_NIMH NIH HHS_United States; UL1 RR024975_RR_NCRR NIH HHS_United States; UL1 TR002243_TR_NCATS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894066,10.21203/rs.3.rs-7031850/v1,40894066,0,0,NONE
40894043,Complex genetic architecture underlies human hand and foot evolution.,"The transition to bipedal locomotion is a key event in human evolution, involving substantial changes to the skeleton, including the bones of the hands and feet (autopods). Hominins evolved a more muscular and opposable thumb while the other fingers are relatively shorter, enhancing manipulative capacity. The feet evolved robust first toes and short lateral toes to meet the challenges of bipedal walking and running. While adaptations in the hand and foot have often been considered separately, the fore- and hind limbs of primates are morphologically integrated, serially homologous structures, raising the possibility that natural selection on either autopod may have driven corresponding changes in the other. To explore the genetic architecture underlying human autopod evolution, we used functional genomics methods to identify regulatory elements and gene expression patterns in the developing phalanges and metacarpals of the human hand and foot. We find that gene expression and regulation differ along the proximal-distal axis and between timepoints but not between limb types or individual digits. We show that thousands of human-specific genomic features fall within autopod regulatory elements, some accessible in multiple tissues, others with tissue-specific accessibility. Our results highlight the complex genomic basis of human autopod evolution.","Okamoto, Alexander; Senevirathne, Gayani; Muthuirulan, Pushpanathan; Rolian, Campbell; Glass, Ian; NONE, NONE; Capellini, Terence","McGill University.; 11.

Particularly, scFUMES pinpoints genetics-informed master metabolic regulators across AD severity, sex and <i>APOE</i> genotype (e.g., PPARD-glycerol in microglia). Experimental testing reveals that two interaction pairs predicted by scFUMES, neuronal palmitic acid bound fatty acid binding protein 3 and gut metabolite indole-3-propionic acid binding to kynurenine aminotransferase 1, both lower pathological tau species in AD. In summary, scFUMES identifies cell type-specific master metabolic regulators, offering insights into cellular metabolic heterogeneity and metabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD and neurodegenerative diseases if broadly applied.","Qiu, Yunguang; Hou, Yuan; Wetzel, Liam; Caldwell, Jessica Z K; Zhu, Xiongwei; Pieper, Andrew A; Liu, Tian; Cheng, Feixiong","Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Neurological Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Las Vegas, NV 89106, USA.; Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Cleveland Clinic Genome Center, Cleveland Clinic Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Geriatric Psychiatry, GRECC, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center; Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Institute for Transformative Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland 44106, OH, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.; Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.",Research square,Res Sq,,2025,08,18,2025,09,15,R01 AG066707_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; RF1 NS133812_NS_NINDS NIH HHS_United States; U01 AG073323_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG092591_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; I01 BX005976_BX_BLRD VA_United States; P30 AG072959_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG086365_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG084250_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG082118_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R21 AG083003_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R03 AG084948_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG092462_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; R01 AG076448_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States; RF1 AG082211_AG_NIA NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40894034,10.21203/rs.3.rs-7207381/v1,40894034,0,0,NONE
40909766,Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of the <i>Spiroplasma glossinidia</i> strain <i>s</i>Gff reveal insights into host interaction and trypanosome resistance in <i>Glossina fuscipes fuscipes</i>.,"Tsetse (<i>Glossina</i> spp.) are vectors of African trypanosomes, the causative agents of Human and African Animal trypanosomiases, diseases that remain significant medical and socioeconomic challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to trypanosomes, tsetse harbor both obligate and facultative symbiotic bacteria that can influence vector competence and reproductive biology. One such facultative symbiont, <i>Spiroplasma glossinidia</i>, infects several tsetse species within the <i>Palpalis</i> subgroup. In <i>Glossina fuscipes fuscipes</i> (<i>Gff</i>), the <i>Spiroplasma glossinidia</i> strain <i>s</i>Gff induces a trypanosome-refractory phenotype and negatively impacts reproductive fitness by reducing female fecundity. However, the mechanisms behind these <i>Spiroplasma</i>-derived phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we report successful <i>in vitro</i> cultivation of <i>s</i>Gff and present complete genomes from three sources: <i>in vitro</i> cultured <i>s</i>Gff and <i>s</i>Gff isolated from both laboratory-maintained and wild-caught (Uganda) <i>Gff</i> flies. Comparative genomic analyses revealed a high degree of similarity in gene content and synteny among these <i>s</i>Gff samples, confirming that they represent isolates of the same strain. Phylogenomic analyses placed <i>s</i>Gff within the <i>Spiroplasma poulsonii</i> clade. The <i>s</i>Gff genome is highly dynamic, containing numerous mobile genetic elements. Additionally, <i>in silico</i> annotations indicate that <i>s</i>Gff relies on its host for both lipids and carbohydrates and produces several toxins, all of which could be implicated in the observed trypanosome refractory phenotype. Finally, comparative transcriptomic analysis of <i>s</i>Gff from host hemolymph versus <i>in vitro</i> culture provided insights into potential factors relevant to host-symbiont interactions. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the nutritional dialogue between <i>s</i>Gff and its host and identify symbiotic products that may contribute to trypanosome resistance. Furthermore, the establishment of an <i>in vitro</i> culture system for <i>s</i>Gff represents a significant resource for future functional studies with potential implications for vector control.","Bruzzese, Daniel J; Gstöttenmayer, Fabian; Weiss, Brian L; Khalil, Hager; Mach, Robert; Abd-Alla, Adly M M; Aksoy, Serap",Vienna University of Technology.; Joint FAO/IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture.; Yale School of Public Health.,Research square,Res Sq,,2025,08,25,2025,09,15,R21 AI163969_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI068932_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI139525_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40909766,10.21203/rs.3.rs-7295611/v1,40909766,0,0,NONE
40831507,Fluctuation structure predicts genome-wide perturbation outcomes.,"Pooled single-cell perturbation screens represent powerful experimental platforms for functional genomics, yet interpreting these rich datasets for meaningful biological conclusions remains challenging. Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent studies of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","Kuznets-Speck, Benjamin; Schwartz, Leon; Sun, Hanxiao; Melzer, Madeline E; Kumari, Nitu; Haley, Benjamin; Prashnani, Ekta; Vaikuntanathan, Suriyanarayanan; Goyal, Yogesh","Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago, LLC, Chicago IL, USA.; Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago IL, USA.; NVIDIA, Santa Clara CA, USA.; NSF-Simons National Institute for Theory and Mathematics in Biology, Chicago IL, USA.; Robert H.

40822142,Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomic Analysis of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit.,"<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is an important cause of nosocomial infections and community-acquired pneumonia. However, the evolutionary convergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) and virulence factors undoubtedly increases the risk of infection and lethality of <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, especially in intensive care units. How to effectively prevent and correctly treat <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infections has become a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. To assess multidrug-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (MDR-KP) resistance patterns in a Neurological ICU (NICU) and guide infection control strategies. A total of 156 non-repetitive <i>K. pneumoniae</i> isolates from the NICU underwent strain identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Six MDR-KP isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS) using high-throughput sequencing technologies, followed by comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the 6 MDR-KP strains exhibited a resistance rate of 59% to 21 commonly used antibiotics, with seven antibiotics showing a resistance rate of 100%. The sequencing results provided basic genomic information such as genome size and GC content for the 6 MDR-KP strains. Six different sequence (ST)-capsular locus (KL) types were identified: ST11-KL47, ST11-KL64, ST23-KL1, ST25-KL2, ST412-KL57, and ST753-KL3. All strains carried multiple resistance genes and virulence factors. Among them (No. P14, P97) are carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) strains, which should attract our sufficient attention. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P116 was more closely related to the reference strain KP20, and P14 had the highest affinity to P97. NICU <i>K. pneumoniae</i> could colonise patients and the ward air environment for a long time, suggesting that there may be a similar evolutionary or direct transmission relationship between strains. The ST11-KL47 and ST11-KL64 phenotypes were the dominant clone types of CRKP in China, suggesting that the ST11-type MDR-KP should be the focus of infection prevention and control in our hospital. Comparative genomics revealed homology and genetic variability of NICU <i>K. pneumoniae</i>.","Yuan, Xiaodong; Yan, Qi; Tao, Li; Ou, Ya; Yang, Na; Yan, Cuiping; Chen, Yumin; Zhang, Shuqing; Ren, Yan; Zhang, Pingshu","Laboratory of Microbiology, Kailuan General Hospital Affiliated to North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, Hebei Province, 063000, People's Republic of China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Kailuan General Hospital Affiliated to North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, Hebei Province, 063000, People's Republic of China.; Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurobiological Function, Tangshan, Hebei Province, 063000, People's Republic of China.; Department of Neurology, Kailuan General Hospital Affiliated to North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, Hebei Province, 063000, People's Republic of China.",Infection and drug resistance,Infect Drug Resist,,2025,08,12,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40822142,10.2147/IDR.S528440,40822142,0,,
40895611,Comparative Genomic Analysis of Tigecycline Resistance Development in Clinical <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Isolates.,"This study investigated the mechanisms underlying the reduced tigecycline sensitivity of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains isolated from infected patients during antimicrobial therapy. The goal is to provide clinical insights into the development of tigecycline resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>, with a focus on multidrug-resistant strains commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections. We conducted dynamic tracking of multidrug-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (MDR-AB) infections in three patients to monitor changes in tigecycline sensitivity during antimicrobial therapy. From each patient, tigecycline-sensitive and -resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> strains were collected and paired into groups. A total of six strains were subjected to molecular typing and phylogenetic analysis to assess the genetic homology between the tigecycline-sensitive and -resistant strains within each group. Whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis were performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions between paired strains, aiming to pinpoint mutated genes. Gene knockout experiments were conducted to validate the role of the identified genes in modulating tigecycline sensitivity and contributing to the development of tigecycline resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Molecular typing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the tigecycline-resistant <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> strains isolated from each patient evolved from the initially infecting tigecycline-sensitive strains. All three patients had received tigecycline therapy before the emergence of tigecycline resistance. Notably, in one patient, resistance developed 21 days after discontinuing tigecycline treatment. Comparative genomic analysis of the paired strains revealed point mutations in the conserved domain of the trimeric autotransporter adhesin in all three groups. Additionally, a frameshift mutation in the <i>acrR</i> gene was identified in two of the three groups. To investigate the role of <i>acrR</i> in the development of tigecycline resistance, an <i>acrR</i> knockout strain was constructed. The results indicated that the <i>acrR</i> gene did not significantly impact tigecycline resistance or biofilm formation. The use of tigecycline promotes the development of tigecycline resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and resistance may continue to evolve even after discontinuing tigecycline treatment. Mutations in the <i>ata, adeS</i>, and <i>acrR</i> genes may contribute to the development of tigecycline resistance in <i>A. baumannii</i>. Although gene knockout experiments in this study showed that <i>acrR</i> did not directly impact tigecycline resistance or biofilm formation, clinical isolates are influenced by a complex, multifactorial environment. Therefore, the role of <i>acrR</i> warrants further investigation.","Li, Xiaoxia; Liu, Junnian; Zhang, Xinyu; Li, Juan; Xuan, Luhan; Yuan, Sue; Li, Jianglin; Sun, Yu; Du, Xuefei","Department of Blood Transfusion, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China.; Clinical Laboratory, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China.; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yunnan Fuwai Cardiovascular Disease Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China.",Infection and drug resistance,Infect Drug Resist,,2025,08,24,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40895611,10.2147/IDR.S539267,40895611,0,0,NONE
40895615,Genomic Investigation of a Bacillus subtilis Strain Sourced from Commercially Available Milk Powder in China Reveals Potential Risk Factors.,"Milk powder is a key food source, especially for infants and vulnerable groups. However, Bacillus contamination during production, storage, or handling can cause spoilage, quality issues, or health risks. This study identified and isolated <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> from commercially available Chinese milk powder. A pure colony of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> was isolated from an LB agar plate supplemented with milk powder and identified using mass spectrometry. The genome of this strain was sequenced using third-generation sequencing technology. Following assembly, the genome was functionally annotated and subjected to comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. Genomic analysis classified the strain as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> via MALDI-TOF and ANI (98.82% with <i>B. subtilis</i> AMR1). Its genome features a 4.26 Mbp chromosome and 97.6 kbp plasmid encoding 4,539 genes, including virulence factors (209 genes), antibiotic resistance genes (19 genes), and carbohydrate-active enzymes (253 genes). Key virulence mechanisms include immune modulation, stress adaptation, toxin production, and biofilm formation. Antibiotic resistance involves efflux pumps (eg, <i>qacJ, bmr</i>), enzymatic inactivation (eg, <i>FosBx1, aadK</i>), and target modification (eg, <i>vanG</i> cluster, <i>tet(45)</i>). Phylogenetically (LIN78), the strain clusters with foodborne <i>B. subtilis</i> isolates (eg, from Korean gochujang and soybean), diverging from <i>B. cereus</i> and environmental <i>Bacillus</i> clades.

Genomic islands, CRISPR arrays, and recombination-associated repeats indicate adaptive evolution. This study characterizes <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> LIN78, a genomically plastic strain isolated from Chinese milk powder.

40874212,ZBED4: A Prognostic Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent lethal cancer that remains challenging to treat. Therefore, investigation of novel targets and therapeutic strategies is essential. The role of ZBED4 in cancer remains unclear. Data were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) databases. Various web platforms and R software, have been utilized. Multiplex immunofluorescence was performed on a human HCC tissue microarray. High ZBED4 expression correlates with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration in multiple cancers. ZBED4 is potentially involved in the regulation of the tumor environment by T cells, with a focus on CD8⁺ T cells. In HCC, tissues with elevated ZBED4 expression exhibit a higher prevalence of Tregs and neutrophils, whereas those with reduced ZBED4 expression show an increased abundance of CD8⁺ T cells, activated CD4⁺ T cells, gamma/delta T cells, and activated natural killer (NK) cells. Elevated ZBED4 expression in HCC patients is associated with a reduced response to immune checkpoint blockade but an improved response to chemotherapy and most targeted therapies. A multi-gene prognostic signature has been developed and confirmed across various HCC cohorts. Multiplex immunofluorescence study demonstrated that ZBED4 was linked to poor prognosis and negatively correlated with CD8⁺ T cell infiltration. Our research elucidates the role of ZBED4, its strong link to immune infiltration, and its potential as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker for HCC.","Ding, Jing; Zou, Xia; Huang, Xuefeng; Yu, Le; Hong, Huangming; Lin, Tongyu","Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.; Department of Medical Oncology, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.",Journal of hepatocellular carcinoma,J Hepatocell Carcinoma,,2025,08,21,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40874212,10.2147/JHC.S546808,40874212,0,0,NONE
40908951,CKS2 Mediates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Related to M2 Macrophages.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence remains a significant burden on global healthcare. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a common complication in liver surgery and may be a contributing factor to HCC recurrence. Nevertheless, the potential mechanism underlying HIRI-induced HCC recurrence has not been fully elucidated. Herein, by combining bioinformatics approaches and basic experimental research, CKS2 was preliminarily identified as a crucial factor involved in HIRI-induced HCC recurrence potentially by modulating M2 macrophages. Through performing Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), differential gene expression analysis, and screening for genes associated with disease-free survival (DFS) on large-scale genomics projects including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the pivotal role of CKS2 in HIRI-induced HCC recurrence was determined. The clinical significance, single-cell analysis, immune cell infiltration correlation, functional enrichment, mutation landscape, and drug sensitivity of CKS2 in HCC were further characterized. Finally, CKS2 expression and function were validated through experimental techniques such as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, Western blot assay and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of CKS2 was significantly upregulated in HIRI and HCC tissues and was closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in HCC patients. There was a positive correlation between CKS2 expression and tumor stemness characteristics. Additionally, high CKS2 expression was strongly linked to M2 macrophage infiltration in HCC tissues. And drug sensitivity analysis indicated that HCC patients with high CKS2 expression were prone to develop drug resistance, complicating clinical anti-tumor treatment. Ultimately, the expression pattern of CKS2 and its correlation with M2 macrophages in HCC were confirmed through experimental validation. CKS2 was identified as a key factor in HIRI-induced HCC recurrence and was critically associated with M2 macrophage infiltration abundance, providing novel insights and a direction for future research.","Xia, Senzhe; Qin, Xueqian; Pan, Chenggeng; Fan, Dingwei; Yang, Daqing","Department of Comprehensive Surgery, Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China.; Department of Comprehensive Surgery, The Dingli Clinical College of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China.; Department of Comprehensive Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai University, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China.; Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Xuzhou Municipal Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou First People's Hospital, Xuzhou, People's Republic of China.",Journal of inflammation research,J Inflamm Res,,2025,08,27,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40908951,10.2147/JIR.S543147,40908951,0,0,NONE

Its association with congenital malformations and neurological disorders underscores the urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions. This review explores molecular targets for ZIKV treatment within the Brazilian context. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on studies identifying druggable molecular targets related to viral replication, immune evasion, or host-virus interactions. Key search terms included ""Zika virus,"" ""molecular targets,"" ""Brazil,"" ""antiviral,"" and ""drug discovery."" The review identified several critical viral proteins, NS1, NS3, NS5, and the envelope protein, as potential drug targets. Host cellular factors essential for viral survival were also highlighted. Technologies such as high-throughput screening, molecular docking, and structural genomics contributed significantly to the identification and validation of these targets. Although promising targets have been identified, therapeutic development is hindered by the genetic variability of ZIKV and its antigenic similarity to other flaviviruses, notably the dengue virus. These challenges complicate the specificity and efficacy of drugs. Nevertheless, Brazil has made strides in research infrastructure and collaborations to tackle these obstacles. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ZIKV molecular targets and ongoing drug discovery efforts. The findings support the strategic development of antivirals and emphasize the necessity for sustained investment in research to mitigate future ZIKV outbreaks in Brazil and globally.","Kleber Rodrigues Lima, Washington; Zeneida Gomes Parente Alves Lima, Claudia; Kleber Gomes Parente Alves Lima, Víctor; Reis Rosário, Willian; Gonçalves Lima-Neto, Lidio; Dos Santos Correia, Maria Tereza; Monteiro Ferreira, Glaucio; Cláudio Nascimento da Silva, Luís","Department of Biochemistry, Protein Biochemistry Laboratory, Center for Biological Sciences, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, 50740-570, Brazil.; Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Av.

40916417,HIV-Associated Lymphomas: Updates from Pathogenesis to Treatment Strategies.,"HIV-associated lymphoma (HAL) is an aggressive malignancy directly linked to HIV infection and accounts for more than 30% of cancer-related deaths in people living with HIV (PLWH). HAL subtypes, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL), exhibit five to ten times higher incidence rates and distinct molecular profiles compared to HIV-negative lympho-mas. Pathogenesis involves HIV-driven CD4+ T-cell depletion, chronic B-cell activation, and on-cogenic viral coinfection. First-line therapy combines antiretroviral therapy (ART) with chemo-therapy, achieving complete remission rates of 60-70% for DLBCL using R-EPOCH and 50-60% for BL with CODOX-M/IVAC. Relapsed/refractory cases show durable responses to CD19-CAR-T therapy; however, only 10% of HAL patients are enrolled in pivotal immunotherapy tri-als. Severe immunosuppression necessitates PET-CT-guided de-escalation and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems to minimize toxicity.

40883027,Programmatically Efficient Separation of Immune Infiltrate and Tumor Gene Expression Overlap Potentials in a Big Data Setting: FASLG Gene Expression-related Survival Distinctions.,"Typically expressed on T-cells and NK cells, FASLG induces apoptosis in target cells upon binding Fas. However, assessing potential FASLG expression in tumor cells with convenient genomics approaches has been challenging. This study applied a novel assessment of FASLG copy numbers (CNs) and gene expression levels, applicable to bulk exome and RNAseq files. Analyses indicated high FASLG CN associated with worse survival outcomes. Interestingly, higher FASLG gene expression was found to be associated with better survival outcomes, which led to a determination of whether this result was due to FASLG expression from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) instead of cancer cells demonstrating the higher CNs. In fact, T-cell markers CD4 and CD8A highly correlated with FASLG expression, consistent with the hypothesis that the high FASLG expression was associated with the TILs. Subsequent analyses confirmed that CN increases led to increased gene expression in the genomic region of the FASLG gene, particularly with an assessment of the expression of the neighboring PRRC2C gene. In sum, FASLG CN assessments, even independently of a corresponding gene expression correlation, may provide important characterizations of tumor cells. This study indicates that FASLG CN increases could represent a mechanism of tumor escape from TILs and a prognostic indicator; and tumor FASLG may be a suitable drug target for reducing tumor evasion of T-cells.","Fletcher, Elizabeth A; Dabkowski, Toriana R; Varkhedi, Mallika; Blanck, George","Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, U.S.A.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, U.S.A.; gblanck@usf.edu.; Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, U.S.A.",Cancer genomics & proteomics,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,"Humans, Fas Ligand Protein, Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating, Neoplasms, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Biomarkers, Tumor, Prognosis",2025,08,29,2025,09,04,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40883027,10.21873/cgp.20531,40883027,0,0,NONE
40857715,Surveillance of the Genetic Signature in Circulating Tumor DNA for Guiding Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Urothelial Carcinoma: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Urothelial carcinoma is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, with a poor 5-year survival rate. As genomics is the backbone of the precision medicine paradigm, the genetic signature in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a pivotal biomarker for detecting early-stage cancer and molecular residual disease (MRD). We aim to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of a ctDNA-based sequencing approach for detecting MRD and guiding adjuvant chemotherapy in postoperative urothelial carcinomas. We will perform a stratified 2-arm pilot randomized controlled trial in 2 tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong, involving patients with urothelial carcinomas (pT2-4a N0-2 M0) undergoing radical resection. We plan to recruit 20 patients and determine stratification according to their MRD status before randomization. Patients in each stratum (MRD-positive and MRD-negative groups) will be randomly allocated to either a 4-cycle gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy arm or a standard management arm in a 1:1 ratio. ctDNA MRD will be tested using a personalized next-generation sequencing panel, which is designed based on the individual's whole exome sequencing results from the operation specimen. The primary outcome is the feasibility of this trial (ie, recruitment, retention, adherence, and completeness). The secondary outcome is treatment-related adverse events. Exploratory outcomes include radiographic disease-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, ctDNA clearance in patients with ctDNA MRD-positive status, quality of life, fear of cancer recurrence, and cost-effectiveness. Benchmarks for feasibility evaluation are set as (1) ≥20% recruitment response rate, (2) ≤20% loss to follow-up or withdrawal, (3) ≥80% intervention adherence, and (4) ≤20% missing value rate. Each benchmark will be assigned one score, and a total score of 4, 2 to 3, and 0 to 1 will be deemed high, medium, and low feasibility, respectively. Safety evaluations will be presented as numbers and proportions of the adverse events. ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for continuous outcome variables, whereas the chi-square test and the Fisher exact test will be used for categorical outcome variables. Hazard ratios will be calculated to compare the preliminary treatment effect of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm against the standard management arm on survival within each MRD group. This project was funded in February 2024. Patient recruitment started on May 2, 2024. Recruitment and data collection for the trial are ongoing. Data analysis will be performed in mid-2025 and the results of this study are expected to be published in late 2025. Genetic signature in ctDNA is informative for personalized management of postoperative urothelial carcinomas, including personalized treatment and early detection of disease progression.

40840463,Multimodal Integration in Health Care: Development With Applications in Disease Management.,"Multimodal data integration has emerged as a transformative approach in the health care sector, systematically combining complementary biological and clinical data sources such as genomics, medical imaging, electronic health records, and wearable device outputs. This approach provides a multidimensional perspective of patient health that enhances the diagnosis, treatment, and management of various medical conditions. This viewpoint presents an overview of the current state of multimodal integration in health care, spanning clinical applications, current challenges, and future directions. We focus primarily on its applications across different disease domains, particularly in oncology and ophthalmology. Other diseases are briefly discussed due to the few available literature. In oncology, the integration of multimodal data enables more precise tumor characterization and personalized treatment plans. Multimodal fusion demonstrates accurate prediction of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy response (area under the curve=0.91). In ophthalmology, multimodal integration through the combination of genetic and imaging data facilitates the early diagnosis of retinal diseases. However, substantial challenges remain regarding data standardization, model deployment, and model interpretability. We also highlight the future directions of multimodal integration, including its expanded disease applications, such as neurological and otolaryngological diseases, and the trend toward large-scale multimodal models, which enhance accuracy. Overall, the innovative potential of multimodal integration is expected to further revolutionize the health care industry, providing more comprehensive and personalized solutions for disease management.","Hao, Yan; Cheng, Chao; Li, Juanjuan; Li, Hongwen; Di, Xingsi; Zeng, Xiaoxia; Jin, Shoumei; Han, Xiaodong; Liu, Chongsong; Wang, Qianqian; Luo, Bingying; Zeng, Xianhai; Li, Ke","Department of Medical Imaging, Shenzhen Longgang Otolaryngology Hospital & Shenzhen Otolaryngology Research Institute, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Dentistry, Shenzhen Longgang Otolaryngology Hospital & Shenzhen Otolaryngology Research Institute, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Ophthalmology, Shenzhen Longgang Otolaryngology Hospital & Shenzhen Otolaryngology Research Institute, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; School of Law, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.; Department of Immunology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; Department of Otolaryngology, Shenzhen Longgang Otolaryngology Hospital & Shenzhen Otolaryngology Research Institute, 186 Huangge Road, Longcheng Subdistrict, Longgang District, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518172, China, 86 (755)28989999.",Journal of medical Internet research,J Med Internet Res,"Humans, Disease Management, Electronic Health Records, Delivery of Health Care",2025,08,21,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40840463,10.2196/76557,40840463,0,0,NONE
40808592,Single-cell atlas of grass carp ( <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>) peripheral blood IgM <sup>+</sup> B cells provides insights into B cell-mediated immune responses in teleost fish.,"Teleost peripheral blood contains a remarkably high proportion of B cells, accounting for 15%-50% of circulating lymphocytes. However, their immune responses to bacterial infection are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, 10× Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to characterize the transcriptomic landscape of peripheral blood IgM <sup>+</sup> B cells in grass carp ( <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>) following challenge with <i>Aeromonas hydrophila</i>, a major aquatic pathogen. Six transcriptionally distinct IgM <sup>+</sup> B cell subpopulations were identified, including (im)mature B cells, innate B cells, proliferating B cells, IgD <sup>high</sup> B cells, and two infection-induced subsets denoted as infection Ⅰ and Ⅱ B cells. Bacterial infection altered the cellular heterogeneity of IgM <sup>+</sup> B cells, triggered metabolic reprogramming in (im)mature and innate B cell subpopulations, and enhanced the immunological activation of circulating B cells. Notably, infection Ⅰ B cells demonstrated robust induction of interferon φ1 ( <i>IFNφ1</i>), a type I IFN, following <i>A. hydrophila</i> exposure. This induction was further validated through <i>in vitro</i> bacterial stimulation, indicating that teleost B cells actively contribute to innate antibacterial responses through IFN signaling. Additionally, the IgD <sup>high</sup> B cell subpopulation remained consistently present in peripheral blood across both infected and uninfected states, pointing to a constitutive and likely mature phenotype. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the heterogeneity of peripheral blood IgM <sup>+</sup> B cells and provide new insights into IgM <sup>+</sup> B cell-mediated immune responses in teleost fish.","Pan, Yi-Ru; Han, Xue-Qing; Tian, Tian-Tian; Zhang, Yong-An; Zhang, Xu-Jie","Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Genome Analysis Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518124, China.

40789620,Development and External Validation of the FluScoreVax Risk Score for Influenza That Incorporates Vaccine Status.,"To develop and externally validate a simple risk score for influenza diagnosis based using vaccination history and patient-reported symptoms. Adult outpatients in 12 European countries during flu season with a chief complaint of acute cough between 2007 and 2010 were used to derive and internally validate the risk score (Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community acquired LRTI in Europe (GRACE) data), and contemporary US data were used for external validation (EAST-PC data). Patient-reported symptoms were recorded and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to diagnose influenza. The score was derived using logistic regression and assigning points based on the <b><i>β</i></b> -coefficients. The score was externally validated in a contemporary US population (EAST-PC data). Accuracy was measured using influenza prevalence in each risk group and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed by plotting observed versus expected. We developed a risk score with 6 items (subjective fever, interfered with usual activity, headache, wheeze, phlegm, and recent flu vaccine) and a range from -5 to 6 points. The AUC was 0.75 for both derivation and internal validation subgroups. The prevalence of influenza was 15.1% in the GRACE data and 14.4% in the EAST-PC data. The percentage with influenza in the low, moderate, and high-risk groups was 6.8%, 21.8%, 35.3 in the external validation population (EAST-PC data). The low-risk group included 61% of participants in the external validation. Calibration was excellent. We developed and externally validated the FluScoreVax risk score, available as an app. It classifies 61% of patients as low risk, of whom only 7% had influenza.","Ebell, Mark H; Chen, Yewen; Luo, Fangzhi; Shen, Ye; Coenen, Samuel; Little, Paul; Barrett, Bruce; Merenstein, Daniel; Ieven, Margareta","From the Department of Family Medicine, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA (MHE); Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA (YC, FL, YS); Centre for General Practice, Department of Family Medicine & Population Health, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, b.

This comprehensive review demonstrates that GPU-optimized AI platforms, including NVIDIA Clara and MONAI frameworks, have achieved remarkable performance improvements ranging from 8x to 65x acceleration in cancer genomics and computational biology applications, while simultaneously reducing operational costs by up to 85%. In medical imaging applications, GPU-based systems have revolutionized cone-beam computed tomography reconstruction, achieving reconstruction times of 77-130 seconds compared to conventional approaches that require significantly longer processing periods, while enabling dramatic radiation dose reductions of 36-72 times without compromising diagnostic image quality. Digital pathology applications have benefited from GPU acceleration through enhanced histopathological image analysis capabilities, including automated gland segmentation for colorectal cancer grading and uncertainty quantification mechanisms that support clinical decision-making processes. The integration of GPU-accelerated AI tools into clinical workflows has enabled real-time processing of complex medical data, automated tumor contouring for radiation therapy planning, and sophisticated radiomics feature extraction that correlates imaging biomarkers with genetic and molecular tumor characteristics.

40912557,Clostridium tyrobutyricum strains exhibit high genetic diversity and differ in their ability to cause late blowing defect in washed-curd cheese.,"Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a spore-forming bacterium and is considered to be one of the main causative agents of late blowing defect (LBD) of hard and semi-hard cheeses. However, the spoilage potential of C. tyrobutyricum appears to be strain dependent. Because previous studies have been mostly limited to laboratory liquid media or experimental food models imitating cheese matrix, we (1) characterized 6 strains of C. tyrobutyricum for their ability to cause LBD in washed-curd cheese aged at 8°C and 15°C, and (2) probed the whole-genome data for the genetic markers linked to LBD. Washed-curd cheeses were made with pasteurized cow milk individually inoculated with different C. tyrobutyricum strains. During cheese aging at 8°C, none of the 6 evaluated strains caused changes in cheese consistent with LBD (i.e., accumulation of gas, formation of cracks, and production of butyric acid). Three of the 6 tested strains were, however, able to cause LBD at 15°C; the remaining 3 C. tyrobutyricum strains showed little or no gas and butyric acid production during 160 d aging at 15°C. All 6 strains were additionally evaluated in 3 separate experiments performed in 2 different liquid media (reinforced clostridial medium and enriched milk medium) to determine germination, growth, and gas formation at temperatures between 8°C and 37°C, and pH values between 6.9 and 4.1. All 6 evaluated strains were able to grow and form gas in a liquid medium in at least one replicate at temperatures and pH values as low as 12.5°C and 5.1, respectively. Comparative genomics showed that the 6 strains exhibit high genetic diversity, without specific genetic features that would explain the observed differences in the ability to cause LBD in washed-curd cheese. Future studies would need to compare a larger set of C. tyrobutyricum strains with demonstrated ability or inability to cause LBD in cheese. This ability to cause LBD will most likely have to be determined in actual cheese experiments, as our results show that growth and gas formation in liquid medium models are not always representative of growth and gas formation in cheese.","Trmčić, Aljoša; Prinčič, Lucija; Pajor, Magdalena; Kalenak, Andre P; Reichler, Samuel J; Orsi, Renato H; Martin, Nicole H; Wiedmann, Martin","Department of Food Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.

Performance was assessed against expert review using standard evaluation metrics; the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 92.9% (sensitivity [recall] 87.1%, specificity 93.7%) in shortlisting 1,328 candidate abstracts, of which 888 are considered relevant by experts, delivering a 5.26-fold enrichment in classification precision. Analysis of correctly identified abstracts revealed comprehensive coverage of key molecular targets, drug classes (immunotherapies and targeted therapies), and relevant cancer types. This pipeline automates literature triage for precision oncology knowledge bases for relevance, maintaining high specificity and potentially reducing manual screening burden whilst offering a scalable framework for sustainable knowledge base maintenance.","Lin, Frank P; Tran, Minh; Thavaneswaran, Subotheni; Grady, John P; Kansara, Maya; Chan, Jeffrey; Ballinger, Mandy L; Simes, John; Thomas, David M","Kinghorn Cancer Centre, St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Australia.; Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine and Health, UNSW Sydney, Australia.; NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, University of Sydney, Australia.; Centre for Molecular Oncology, UNSW Sydney, Australia.",Studies in health technology and informatics,Stud Health Technol Inform,"Precision Medicine, Decision Trees, Medical Oncology, Humans, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Bases, Data Mining, Data Curation, Neoplasms, Large Language Models",2025,07,24,2025,08,08,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40775857,10.3233/SHTI250839,40775857,0,,

40899537,Whole Exome Sequencing on FHIR: Towards Adoption in Clinical Practice for Precision Oncology Pipelines.,"Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) promises to open a new range of personalized treatments due to breaking the limits of former panel-based methods of molecular analysis. While the methodology is well established and already included in clinical practice, data standardization is still lacking and potentially limiting implementation of machine-based data processing due to a lack of syntactic and semantic interoperability. The HL7 FHIR standard provides the mechanisms to retain interoperability while being sufficiently flexible to accommodate semantic concepts. Based on the clinical WES pipeline for the analysis of cancer tissues of the University Hospital Heidelberg, we created a UML like model and subsequently an Implementation Guide (IG) representing data contained in the molecular pathological report in FHIR considering the work of the HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup and extending the specification wherever necessary to be able to represent and persist the data in the FHIR format.

40909996,Towards a precision approach to anesthetic/analgesic immunomodulation in cancer.,"Immunomodulation is widely invoked to explain possible effects of anesthetic/analgesic drugs on recurrence and survival in cancer patients. By analogy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which enhance anti-tumor actions of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to develop a precision approach to immunomodulation by anesthetic/analgesic drugs. We explore biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy response [tumor mutational burden (TMB)] and resistance [fraction genome altered (FGA)] in relation to anesthetic/analgesic dose to survival response and the expression of drug target receptor genes. Two local clinical cohorts [lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients] were analyzed retrospectively to yield statistical interactions between drugs, outcomes, and TMB/FGA (extending previously reported results). Bulk tumor gene expression data for solid tumors from 6,488 patients across 18 solid tumor types was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normalized by tumor type. TMB and FGA for each TCGA patient sample was extracted from cBioPortal. DeSeq was employed to quantify differential gene expression of target receptors of 79 common anesthetic/analgesic drugs for high/low TMB and FGA. Localization of these receptors to specific immune cells was estimated using CIBERSORT. Increased TMB and FGA magnified opioid pro-tumor effects on overall survival in LUAD, while increased TMB reduced ketamine anti-tumor effects on recurrence and did not affect ketorolac anti-tumor effects on recurrence. In COAD, increased TMB (DNA mismatch repair deficiency) magnified opioid anti-tumor effects on recurrence. Drug target receptor gene expression (and immune cell-type specificity) correlated with both TMB and FGA as a function of cancer type. TMB and FGA may have utility as biomarkers predictive of individual cancer patient response to anesthetic/analgesic dose effects on survival due to immunomodulation. Correlation across cancer types of anesthetic/analgesic target receptor gene expression with TMB and FGA and with TME immune cell types suggests molecular/omics level targets for further mechanistic exploration. A precision oncoanalgesia approach in the cancer patient may ultimately be warranted to optimize oncological outcomes.","Gupta, Hersh V; Tan, Kay S; Fischer, Gregory W; Mincer, Joshua S","Biostatistics Service, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Anesthesiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States.",Frontiers in anesthesiology,Front Anesthesiol,,2024,12,05,2025,09,07,P30 CA008748_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40909996,10.3389/fanes.2024.1464004,40909996,0,0,NONE
40837403,In silico analysis of CSF2RB from cancer genomic databases reveals a heterogeneous role in different breast cancer subtypes.,"<i>CSF2RB</i> is the common beta chain of the heterodimeric receptors for the cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and interleukin 5 (IL-5). The activation of these cell surface receptors results in functional responses including cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and maturation via multiple signaling pathways such as JAK2/STAT5, MAPK, and PI3-kinase/AKT. Moreover, <i>CSF2RB</i> is abnormally expressed in a variety of tumors, especially in leukemia. The implications of <i>CSF2RB</i> in breast cancer remain unclear and have not been widely studied. We analyzed <i>CSF2RB</i> genetic changes, mRNA expression, DNA methylation, prognosis, and immune infiltration levels across different tumor types, with a focus on breast and hematological malignancies. The data used in this study were obtained from publicly available cancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, cBioPortal, TIMER2.0, GEPIA, and UALCAN. Our <i>in silico</i> analyses showed overexpression of <i>CSF2RB</i> in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and decreased expression in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) compared to matched normal samples. Promoter methylation of <i>CSF2RB</i> was elevated in BRCA samples compared to normal samples. Our analysis further demonstrates that the <i>CSF2RB</i> gene has a favorable prognostic effect in BRCA, although this was not statistically significant across all databases studied. We found that BRCA and its subtypes exhibit high CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration levels that are positively correlated with the <i>CSF2RB</i> gene expression level. Wild-type <i>CSF2RB</i> shows higher expression than the mutated <i>CSF2RB</i> in breast cancer. <i>CSF2RB</i> expression (and/or mutation) has no significant effect on the overall survival probability. <i>CSF2RB</i> expression is downregulated in luminal and HER2-positive samples but upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), compared to that in normal samples. The results suggest a diverse role for the <i>CSF2RB</i> gene across different subtypes of breast cancer. To attribute a clear role to <i>CSF2RB</i> in breast cancer, further functional studies focusing on differential gene expression, methylation, and their prognostic effect in each breast cancer subtype are required.","Alshelaiel, Raghad; Alkushi, Abdulmohsen; Alriyees, Lolwah Abdullah; Alamro, Abir Abdullah; Alanazi, Humidah; Alhareeri, Areej; AlMuzzaini, Bader; Rashid, Mamoon","Clinical Laboratory Sciences Department, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of AI and Bioinformatics, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Medical Genomics, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Surgery, King Abdulaziz Medical City, MNGHA, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; College of Science and Health Professions, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Frontiers in bioinformatics,Front Bioinform,,2025,08,05,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40837403,10.3389/fbinf.2025.1606828,40837403,0,0,NONE
40910024,Using reinforcement learning in genome assembly: in-depth analysis of a Q-learning assembler.,"Genome assembly remains an unsolved problem, and de novo strategies (i.e., those run without a reference) are relevant but computationally complex tasks in genomics. Although de novo assemblers have been previously successfully applied in genomic projects, there is still no ""best assembler"", and the choice and setup of assemblers still rely on bioinformatics experts. Thus, as with other computationally complex problems, machine learning has emerged as an alternative (or complementary) way to develop accurate, fast and autonomous assemblers. Reinforcement learning has proven promising for solving complex activities without supervision, such as games, and there is a pressing need to understand the limits of this approach to ""real-life"" problems, such as the DNA fragment assembly problem. In this study, we analyze the boundaries of applying machine learning via reinforcement learning (RL) for genome assembly. We expand upon the previous approach found in the literature to solve this problem by carefully exploring the learning aspects of the proposed intelligent agent, which uses the Q-learning algorithm. We improved the reward system and optimized the exploration of the state space based on pruning and in collaboration with evolutionary computing (>300% improvement). We tested the new approaches on 23 environments. Our results suggest the unsatisfactory performance of the approaches, both in terms of assembly quality and execution time, providing strong evidence for the poor scalability of the studied reinforcement learning approaches to the genome assembly problem. Finally, we discuss the existing proposal, complemented by attempts at improvement that also proved insufficient. In doing so, we contribute to the scientific community by offering a clear mapping of the limitations and challenges that should be taken into account in future attempts to apply reinforcement learning to genome assembly.","Padovani, Kleber; Borges, Rafael Cabral; Xavier, Roberto; Carvalho, André Carlos; Reali, Anna; Chateau, Annie; Alves, Ronnie","Institute of Natural Sciences, Federal University of Pará, Belém, Pará, Brazil.; Polytechnic School, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Data Science, Vale Institute of Technology, Belém, Pará, Brazil.; Center for Higher Studies of Itacoatiara, University of the State of Amazonas, Itacoatiara, Amazonas, Brazil.; Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil.; Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.",Frontiers in bioinformatics,Front Bioinform,,2025,08,20,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40910024,10.3389/fbinf.2025.1633623,40910024,0,0,NONE

Leveraging the ultra-fast alignment capabilities of DIAMOND, which is 100 to 20,000 times faster than BLAST, D2GO enables rapid functional annotation of large-scale datasets. D2GO maps GO terms from pre-annotated sequences in the NCBI non-redundant database to query sequences. During benchmarking, D2GO assigned over 2 million GO terms to 98% of 130,184 predicted human protein isoforms in under 13 min on a standard laptop. In addition to annotation, D2GO includes an enrichment analysis tool that allows users to identify significantly overrepresented GO terms between subsets of sequences. We compared D2GO against two widely used tools, Blast2GO and eggNOG-mapper, and observed substantial differences in the number and type of annotations produced. These discrepancies reflect varying sensitivities and specificities across tools and suggest that using multiple methods in tandem may improve overall annotation coverage.

40904932,Highly efficient gene editing of <i>Feline herpesvirus 1</i> using CRISPR/Cas9 combined with FACS.,"<i>Feline herpesvirus 1</i> (<i>FHV-1</i>) is a major causative agent of feline viral rhinotracheitis and ocular lesions. Due to its large DNA genome, the construction of recombinant <i>FHV-1</i> viruses presents considerable challenges for conventional methodologies. In this study, we implemented an integrated strategy combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enable the rapid and efficient generation of recombinant <i>FHV-1</i> viruses. Specifically, the thymidine kinase (<i>tk</i>) gene was disrupted by inserting a monomeric Cherry (mCherry) reporter gene, and the glycoprotein E (<i>gE</i>) gene was similarly interrupted through the incorporation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables precise, site-specific genomic modifications, while FACS allows for effective enrichment and isolation of the desired recombinant viral populations. This combined approach significantly reduces the time required for recombinant virus generation from weeks to days, thereby offering substantial potential to expedite vaccine development and advance functional genomics research.","Wang, Hai-Ming; Xu, Shi-Jia; Cai, Bing-Yan; Qiu, Wen-Ying; Lu, Hui; Tang, Yan-Dong","College of Veterinary Medicine, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.; State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.; Department of Veterinary Medicine, Jiangsu Agri-animal Husbandry Vocational College, Taizhou, Jiangsu, China.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"CRISPR-Cas Systems, Gene Editing, Animals, Varicellovirus, Cats, Flow Cytometry, Thymidine Kinase, Genes, Reporter, Herpesviridae Infections, Green Fluorescent Proteins",2025,08,19,2025,09,06,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40904932,10.3389/fcimb.2025.1660446,40904932,0,0,NONE
40836990,Single cell phototransfection of mRNAs encoding SARS-CoV2 spike and nucleocapsid into human astrocytes results in RNA dependent translation interference.,"Multi-RNA co-transfection is starting to be employed to stimulate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. While there are good reasons to utilize such an approach, there is little background on whether there are synergistic RNA-dependent cellular effects. To address this issue, we use transcriptome-induced phenotype remodeling (TIPeR) via phototransfection to assess whether mRNAs encoding the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus into single human astrocytes (an endogenous human cell host for the virus) and mouse 3T3 cells (often used in high-throughput therapeutic screens) synergistically impact host cell biologies. An RNA concentration-dependent expression was observed where an increase of RNA by less than 2-fold results in reduced expression of each individual RNAs. Further, a dominant inhibitory effect of Nucleocapsid RNA upon Spike RNA translation was detected that is distinct from codon-mediated epistasis. Knowledge of the cellular consequences of multi-RNA transfection will aid in selecting RNA concentrations that will maximize antigen presentation on host cell surface with the goal of eliciting a robust immune response. Further, application of this single cell stoichiometrically tunable RNA functional genomics approach to the study of SARS-CoV-2 biology promises to provide details of the cellular sequalae that arise upon infection in anticipation of providing novel targets for inhibition of viral replication and propagation for therapeutic intervention.","Kim, Hyun-Bum; Brosseau, Quentin; Radzio, Julia; Wang, Jinhui; Muramatsu, Hiromi; Kuang, Da; Grady, M Sean; Chen, H Isaac; Wolf, John A; Ulyanova, Alexandra V; Bartfai, Tamas; Kim, Junhyong; Pardi, Norbert; Sul, Jai-Yoon; Arratia, Paulo; Eberwine, James","Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Neurosurgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.; Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.",Frontiers in drug delivery,Front Drug Deliv,,2024,03,05,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40836990,10.3389/fddev.2024.1359700,40836990,0,0,NONE
40881170,Machine learning tools for deciphering the regulatory logic of enhancers in health and disease.,"Transcriptional enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that control the levels and spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression during development, homeostasis, and pathophysiological processes. Enhancer identification and characterization at the genome-wide scale rely on their structural characteristics, such as chromatin accessibility, binding of transcription factors and cofactors, activating histone modifications, 3D interactions with other regulatory elements, as well as functional characteristics measured by massively parallel reporter assays and sequence conservation approaches. Recently, machine learning approaches and particularly deep learning models (Enformer, BPNet, DeepSTARR, etc.) allow the prediction of enhancers, the impact of variants on their activity and the inference of transcription factor binding sites, leading, among others, to the construction of the first completely synthetic enhancers. We present the above computational tools and discuss their diverse applications towards cracking the enhancer regulatory code, which could have far-reaching ramifications for uncovering essential regulatory mechanisms and diagnosing and treating diseases. With an emphasis on sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, we discuss computational approaches to identify sepsis-associated endotypes, circuits, and immune cell states and signatures characteristic of this condition, which could aid in developing novel therapies.","Foutadakis, Spyros; Bourika, Vasiliki; Styliara, Ioanna; Koufargyris, Panagiotis; Safarika, Asimina; Karakike, Eleni","4th Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; Neonatal Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.",Frontiers in genetics,Front Genet,,2025,08,13,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40881170,10.3389/fgene.2025.1603687,40881170,0,0,NONE
40822280,Time to link camel genomics and traits by bridging the phenotypic gap.,"Camels (<i>Camelus dromedarius</i> and <i>Camelus bactrianus</i>) are indispensable to the economy and culture of arid and semi-arid regions, providing milk, meat, transportation, and labor while demonstrating remarkable adaptations to extreme environments. Recent advances in camel genomics have unraveled key genetic insights related to diversity, physiological adaptation, and productivity traits. However, translating these genomic discoveries into practical applications remains limited by a critical gap in phenotypic data, standardized trait recording, and robust pedigree infrastructure essential foundations for implementing genomic selection (GS) effectively. The lack of high-density SNP arrays, variable linkage disequilibrium patterns, and incomplete genome assemblies further complicate efforts to identify causal variants, cautioning against overinterpreting GWAS results. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of camel genomics, emphasizing key genetic markers associated with growth, meat and milk production, coat color, athletic performance, environmental adaptation, cartilage integrity, and behavioral traits. Additionally, it highlights the importance of modeling genotype-by-environment interactions (G × E) and adopting advanced statistical approaches, such as random regression and reaction norm models, to capture complex trait architectures. Drawing lesson from other livestock, we propose a strategic roadmap that includes the development of high-density SNP arrays, improved genome assemblies, standardized trait recording, and establishment of large, connected training populations. International collaboration through a camel genomics consortium is essential to harmonize data, enhance genetic connectedness, and enable multi-environment evaluations. Addressing these research gaps will facilitate the development of precision breeding, climate-resilient livestock strategies, and sustainable conservation initiatives, ensuring that camels continue to thrive amid growing environmental and economic challenges.","Almathen, Faisal; Salim, Bashir","Camel Research Center, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.",Frontiers in genetics,Front Genet,,2025,07,31,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40822280,10.3389/fgene.2025.1627229,40822280,0,,
40809842,Methanol fixation and tagmentation of RNA/DNA hybrids directly enable single-cell transcriptome sequencing.,"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating cellular diversity in normal development and disease. However, prevalent methods predominantly employ 3'-end sequencing of transcripts, limiting the analysis of alternative splicing and other post-transcriptional processes. While full-length single-cell transcriptome sequencing methods, such as Smart-seq, offer more comprehensive information, but are restricted by low-throughput. To overcome these limitations, we propose a strategy that combines <i>in situ</i> reverse transcription and transposition with a high-throughput micro-fluid platform to enable scalable full-length transcriptome profiling at single-cell resolution. In this study, we utilized methanol fixation on cultured cells to evaluate RNA integrity and cellular preservation post-fixation. <i>In situ</i> reverse transcription followed by RNA/DNA hybrids transposition was performed to test the efficiency of these reactions. The transposed fragments were sequenced and investigated to determine transcriptome capture efficiency. Finally, we combined <i>in situ</i> reactions with the 10X Genomics scATAC-seq platform to prepare a single-cell transcriptome library, aiming to assess the feasibility of full-length transcriptome sequencing at the single-cell level using this combined approach. Methanol fixation enables preservation of RNA and facilitates <i>in situ</i> reverse transcription of full-length cDNA. Importantly, cells maintain their integrality after reverse transcription and transposition even under low concentration of methanol. Reducing the methanol concentration to 40% further enhances transcript capture efficiency. At the single-cell level, this strategy enables the capture of full-length transcriptomes, demonstrating a great potential for application in single-cell sequencing.","Xu, Tao; Xu, Yicong; An, Ziyang; Li, Yiheng; Yang, Jiawen; Zhang, Weixing; Xu, Jin","State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",Frontiers in genetics,Front Genet,,2025,07,30,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40809842,10.3389/fgene.2025.1629655,40809842,0,,

40873563,Clonal divergence and genomic meltdown in prostatic pleomorphic giant cell adenocarcinoma.,"Pleomorphic giant cell adenocarcinoma (PGCA) of the prostate is a rare, aggressive variant characterized by multinucleated giant cells, sarcomatoid features, and resistance to conventional therapies. Despite its recognition in the WHO 2016 guidelines, the molecular drivers and clinicopathological correlates of PGCA remain poorly characterized. This study presents the first integrative clinicogenomic profiling of PGCA, revealing a novel prognostic gene signature with direct implications for diagnosis and treatment. We conducted comprehensive clinicopathological and genomic analyses of a treatment-refractory PGCA case using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), whole-exome sequencing (WES), clonal evolution modeling, and multicohort validation. IHC assessed key prostate cancer markers (AR, AMACR, KLK3, PTEN, NKX3-1, VIM), while WES compared somatic alterations in PGCA, adjacent adenocarcinoma, and stromal tissue. Public datasets (prostate_dkfz_2018, prad_tcga, prad_mcspc_mskcc_2020) were used for external validation. PGCA displayed profound pleomorphism, necrosis, and complete loss of luminal markers (AR/AMACR/KLK3), along with strong vimentin (VIM) expression, consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. WES revealed PGCA-specific mutations enriched in cell-cycle and inflammatory response pathways, distinct from metabolic alterations in the adjacent adenocarcinoma. Clonal evolution analysis showed divergent progression from a shared ancestral clone. Importantly, mutations in ADAMTS7, CDH1, DRD5, MGAT5, and TP53 emerged as a robust five-gene signature predictive of biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival, validated across multiple independent cohorts. Our study provides the first molecular roadmap of prostatic PGCA to date, establishing a novel five-gene prognostic signature and revealing fundamental insights into its pathogenesis through divergent evolution from conventional adenocarcinoma. These insights offer new opportunities for precise diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and targeted therapeutic strategies for this lethal prostate cancer variant.","Ma, Xiaoshi; Chen, Kun; Zhang, Jing; Liu, Liming; Luo, Jiping; Huang, Kaipeng; Zhang, Hongying; Liu, Danni; Gou, Jizhou; Feng, Changyin; Zhao, Xia; Li, Wanying; Chen, Lipeng; Yin, Li; Meng, Xianlin; Cheng, Zhiqiang","Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital (The First Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, The Fourth School of Clinical Medicine of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Laboratory, Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital (Peking University BinHai Hospital), Tianjin, China.; Department of Urology, Shenzhen People's Hospital (The First Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital and Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Prevention and Control, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Collaborative Innovation Center of Tumor Individualized Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.; Department of Bioinformatics, HaploX Biotechnology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Pathology, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital (The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Department of Experimental Research, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.",Frontiers in immunology,Front Immunol,"Aged, Humans, Male, Adenocarcinoma, Biomarkers, Tumor, Clonal Evolution, Exome Sequencing, Genomics, Giant Cells, Mutation, Prognosis, Prostatic Neoplasms",2025,08,12,2025,09,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40873563,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1609340,40873563,0,0,NONE
40777034,Blood samples collected under anesthesia can be used as a source of non-diseased controls for immune-based assays.,"Recruiting very young, healthy children to serve as age-matched controls in research presents substantial ethical and practical challenges. One potential approach to address this issue is to recruit healthy children who are referred for elective procedures under general anesthesia. As infants are typically anesthetized using volatile anesthetics before cannula insertion for additional drug administration, blood samples become readily accessible after the onset of drug-induced coma. However, since prolonged exposure to inhaled anesthetic agents is known to have immune-modulating effects that could affect their suitability as experimental controls, we aimed to investigate whether immune changes are also present in samples collected immediately after gas induction in children undergoing elective dental procedures. The composition and transcriptional profile of whole blood immune cells were assessed using multiparameter flow cytometry and bulk RNA-sequencing, respectively. Cryopreserved PBMCs were used to study changes in the phenotype of polyclonally activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by single-cell RNA sequencing using the 10x Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) platform. We report that inhaled anesthetic induction with a combination of nitrous oxide and sevoflurane has minimal effect on immune system composition and transcriptional profiles, and does not alter the phenotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB).

40842837,Protein functional domain analysis enhances genotype-phenotype associations in comparative genomic studies of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.,"<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)</i> represents a paradigm for studies on antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, despite the considerable number of genome sequences that have been released in recent years, there is still a paucity of knowledge regarding the genomic determinants of the typical phenotypic traits associated with pulmonary infection. The genomes of 40 strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> were sequenced over an 8-year period (2007-2014), isolated from the sputum of a single patient with cystic fibrosis in Trentino, Italy. The same isolates were characterised for a panel of 14 phenotypes, including biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, secretion of siderophores and virulence factors. The phylogenetic coherence of the measured phenotypes was determined in relation to the tree based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Subsequently, the semantic framework for comparative functional genomics (SAPP) was employed to investigate the depletion or enrichment of specific protein functional domains within the population in relation to the observed phenotypes. The majority of our findings regarding phenotypic adaptation over time were consistent with the population structure and followed the evolutionary pathways described in the literature. However, an exact relationship between the presence of genes and specific phenotypes could not be established. The SAPP approach enabled the identification of 189 protein domains that were significantly enriched in antibiotic-resistant strains, as well as 87 domains associated with other phenotypic adaptations. In some cases, the domains were commonly associated with antibiotic resistances, for example, outer membrane efflux pumps and porins. However, we also detected a number of domains with unknown function. Our findings provide a foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of the phenotypic adaptations occurring during microevolution in lung environments and facilitate the identification of new targets for the design of novel antimicrobial agents.","Bianconi, Irene; Esposito, Alfonso; Piazza, Silvano; Piffer, Elena; Pagani, Elisabetta; Jousson, Olivier","Computational Biology Unit, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, ICGEB, Trieste, Italy.; Department of Cellular, Computational and Integrative Biology - CIBIO, University of Trento, Trento, Italy.; Laboratory of Microbiology and Virology, Provincial Hospital of Bolzano (SABES-ASDAA), Lehrkrankenhaus der Paracelsus Medizinischen Privatuniversität, Bolzano, Italy.",Frontiers in microbiology,Front Microbiol,,2025,08,06,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40842837,10.3389/fmicb.2025.1569118,40842837,0,0,NONE

Confocal microscopy revealed robust biofilm formation at 45-55°C under neutral to slightly alkaline pH, with strong EPS matrix development. EPS production was optimized using OFAT and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), achieving a yield of 2.11 g L<sup>-1</sup> under optimized conditions, which was further validated using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.9909). The EPS exhibited promising antioxidant activity and significant emulsification potential across various vegetable oils, which were comparable or superior to commercial bacterial EPS xanthan gum. Notably, the EPS also showed cytotoxic effects against AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells, reducing viability by 38.38 and 37% at 50-100 μg μL<sup>-1</sup> concentrations, respectively, suggesting potential anticancer activity. Altogether, the study highlights <i>B. licheniformis</i> Tol1 as a multifunctional thermophile with valuable biotechnological potential, particularly for applications in food, pharmaceutical, and biomedical industries.","Meza, Cynthia; Sepulveda, Benjamin; Flores-Castañón, Nicolás; Valenzuela, Francisca; Ormeño, Catherine; Castillo, Alexis; Echeverría-Vega, Alex; Jasem Mohammed Breig, Sura; Alardhi, Saja Mohsen; Gonzalez, Alex; Mora-Lagos, Bárbara; Banerjee, Aparna","Centro de Investigación de Estudios Avanzados del Maule (CIEAM), Vicerrectoría de Investigación y Postgrado, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.; Functional Polysaccharides Research Group, Instituto de Ciencias Aplicadas, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Sede Talca, Talca, Chile.; Biology Department, Al-Rasheed University College, Baghdad, Iraq.; Doctorado en Ciencias Biomédicas, Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca, Chile.; Instituto de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Temuco, Chile.; Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Research Center, University of Technology, Baghdad, Iraq.; Ingeniería en Biotecnología, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.; Doctorado en Biotecnología Traslacional, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales, Universidad Católica del Maule, Talca, Chile.; Laboratorio de Microbiología Ambiental y Extremófilos, Departamento de Ciencias Biológicas y Biodiversidad, Universidad de Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile.; Programa de Investigación en Biomedicina y Biotecnología en Salud, Departamento de Salud, Universidad de los Lagos, Osorno, Chile.",Frontiers in microbiology,Front Microbiol,,2025,08,04,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40831643,10.3389/fmicb.2025.1622325,40831643,0,,
40809044,Comparative genomic analysis reveals the adaptive traits of <i>Ralstonia</i> spp. in aquatic environments.,"<i>Ralstonia</i> spp. are highly adaptable bacteria that are widely distributed across diverse environments. Here, we isolated four <i>Ralstonia pickettii</i> (<i>R. pickettii</i>) genomes from cultures of <i>Dolichospermum</i> spp., and using a comparative genomic framework of 228 <i>Ralstonia</i> genomes. We performed phylogenetic analyses that grouped them into water, soil, plant, and human-associated clades based on their predominant isolation habitats. Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed minimal physical interactions between <i>R. pickettii</i> and cyanobacterial cells, indicating a commensal or independent ecological relationship. Distinct differences in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and secondary metabolite profiles were observed between water and human-associated dominant groups compared to plant-associated dominant groups, highlighting potential niche-specific adaptations. The water-associated dominant groups harbored antibiotic resistance genes, including <i>CeoB</i> and <i>OXA</i>-type <i>β</i>-lactamase genes. These genes are typically linked to human-associated strains, suggesting potential horizontal gene transfer or shared selective pressures, and the gene content of T3SS is reduced. Notably, water-associated dominant groups exhibited a unique pyrimidine degradation pathway, potentially enabling the utilization of exogenous pyrimidines to support survival in nutrient-limited aquatic environments. We propose that the gene content loss of T3SS and the acquisition of specialized metabolic pathways reflect adaptive strategies of <i>Ralstonia</i> spp. for thriving in aquatic free-living niches.","Liu, Gaopeng; Mao, Chengzhi; Li, Qi; Huo, Da; Li, Tao","State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.; College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.",Frontiers in microbiology,Front Microbiol,,2025,07,30,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40809044,10.3389/fmicb.2025.1625651,40809044,0,,
40909932,Omics insights into <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> LMY3-5 defense against <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> in kiwifruit.,"<i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> is the main cause of soft rot in kiwifruit, significantly reducing both yield and quality. While chemical treatments are commonly used, their effectiveness is limited and they may pose environmental risks. As a result, biological control using Bacillus species has emerged as a promising alternative. In this study, we explored the antifungal mechanism of the biocontrol strain <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> LMY3-5 against kiwifruit soft rot through integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses. In terms of antagonistic activity: <i>B. velezensis</i> LMY3-5 exhibits strong antagonism against <i>B. dothidea</i>, the causal agent of kiwifruit soft rot, showing a 70.44% biocontrol efficacy in inoculation tests. In terms of genomic features: genome 4.03 Mb circular chromosome with 46.5% GC content. Eight antimicrobial BGCs were identified, including those for surfactin, fengycin, bacillaene, bacillibactin, and others, explaining its biocontrol potential. In terms of transcriptomic insights: during coculture with <i>B. dothidea</i>, 114 DEGs (31 upregulated, 93 downregulated) were detected. Downregulated: flagellar assembly and chemotaxis genes (suggesting reduced motility during antagonism). Upregulated: genes linked to fengycin, siderophores, and lysozyme production, critical for antifungal activity. In terms of mechanism and implications lipopeptides (e.g., fengycin) and siderophores are key in inhibiting fungal growth. Findings support LMY3-5's potential as a biocontrol agent for plant protection against <i>B. dothidea</i>. The main conclusion of this study is LMY3-5 combats <i>B. dothidea</i> via antimicrobial metabolites, with genomics and transcriptomics revealing its molecular basis for biocontrol. This strain holds promise for sustainable plant disease management.

40822386,"Isolation, identification and comparative genomic analysis of <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> from Mongolian horse vagina.","Reproductive health in mares is pivotal for the sustainability of the equine industry, yet vaginal microbiota dysbiosis remains an underrecognized contributor to infections such as endometritis and bacterial vaginosis. While <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. dominate healthy vaginal ecosystems in humans and livestock, their role in equine reproductive health, particularly in resilient breeds like Mongolian mares, is poorly understood. This study aimed to isolate and characterize a novel <i>Lactobacillus</i> strain from the vaginal microbiota of healthy Mongolian mares and evaluate its probiotic potential for mitigating equine reproductive disorders. A polyphasic approach integrating phenotypic, biochemical, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to isolate and identify a novel <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> strain (Y20) from the vaginal microbiota of healthy Mongolian mares. The probiotic potential of Y20 was assessed through <i>in vitro</i> assays, including tolerance to low pH (pH 2.5) and bile salts (0.3%), antagonistic activity against equine pathogens (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>), and antioxidant capacity (DPPH radical scavenging assay). Whole-genome sequencing (1.74 Mb, 33.01% GC content) was performed to analyze genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, adhesion factors, bacteriocin biosynthesis, and stress response pathways. Comparative genomics was used to explore phylogenetic relationships and genomic adaptations for vaginal colonization. <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> Y20 demonstrated robust tolerance to low pH and bile salts, potent antagonistic activity against key equine pathogens, and significant antioxidant capacity (82.4% DPPH radical scavenging). Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding carbohydrate metabolism, adhesion factors, bacteriocin biosynthesis (including a novel putative bacteriocin cluster), and stress response pathways. Comparative genomics confirmed Y20's close phylogenetic relationship with horse-derived <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> strains and identified unique genomic adaptations for vaginal colonization. These findings identify <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> Y20 as a promising candidate probiotic for mitigating equine reproductive disorders. Its multifaceted probiotic properties, including pathogen inhibition, antioxidant activity, and genomic adaptations for vaginal colonization, suggest potential applications in sustainable equine health management.

40777132,Immunogenic cell death-related genes as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic insights in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma: an integrative bioinformatics analysis.,"Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is the phenomenon in which tumor cells undergo the transition from a non-immunogenic state to an immunogenic state upon their demise as a result of external stimuli. While ICD systems have been widely adopted in oncological research, their specific utilization for Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) investigations has received comparatively little attention. The ICD score was assessed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from transcriptomic data processed with the ""DESeq2"" R package. A prognostic model was then developed by integrating these DEGs with clinical variables. The immune landscape was characterized through multiple bioinformatics approaches, and immunotherapy response was predicted using the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis was performed based on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In this study, we calculated ICD scores based on 74 ICD-related genes to explore the role of ICD in UCEC progression. We observed that patients with higher ICD scores exhibited a more favorable prognosis, and the score showed a positive correlation with mutation burden (r=0.16, P<0.001). Then we identified 587 upregulated DEGs and 153 downregulated DEGs in high-ICD group compared to low-ICD group. The former was predominantly associated with immune pathways, which was validated in GEO dataset. Using the 64 common DEGs obtained from both TCGA and GEO datasets, we developed a prognostic model specifically tailored for UCEC patients, incorporating five optimal prognostic genes (CD52, SLC30A3, ST8SIA5, STAT1 and TRBC1). Furthermore, the inclusion of clinical factors (stage and ICD score) significantly enhanced the model's predictive ability. The ICD score exhibited positive correlations with immune cell infiltration, as verified by ESTIMATE, xCell, TIMER, MCPcounter, EPIC, and IPS algorithms. Finally, we found that hyper-immunogenicity may be sensitive to immunotherapy and certain drugs (AZD5991, Ibrutinib, Osimertinib, AGI-5198, Savolitinib, Sapitinib, AZ960, AZD3759 and Ruxolitinib), while PCI-34051 and Vorinostat showed sensitivity in patients with hypo-immunogenicity. Our results demonstrate that ICD plays an important role in UCEC progression, suggesting that ICD-related markers could serve as potential targets for prognosis and treatment.","Yi, Tianfei; Yang, Zhenglun; Shen, Peng; Huang, Yan","Department of Monitoring and Early Warning, YinZhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Ningbo, China.; Department of Gynaecology, YinZhou Third Hospital, Ningbo, China.; Department of Radiology, The Affiliated People's Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.",Frontiers in oncology,Front Oncol,,2025,07,24,2025,08,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777132,10.3389/fonc.2025.1588703,40777132,0,,
40909977,Diagnosis methods for pancreatic cancer with the technique of deep learning: a review and a meta-analysis.,"Early diagnosis can significantly improve survival rate of Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but due to the insidious and non-specific early symptoms, most patients are not suitable for surgery when diagnosed. Traditional imaging techniques and an increasing number of non-imaging diagnostic methods have been used for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) through deep learning (DL). This review summarizes diagnosis methods for pancreatic cancer with the technique of deep learning and looks forward to the future development directions of deep learning for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. This study follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, retrieving studies on deep learning for early pancreatic cancer diagnosis from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE, and Cochrane Library over the past 5 years. Inclusion criteria were studies involving PDAC patients, using deep learning algorithms for diagnosis evaluation, using histopathological results as the reference standard, and having sufficient data. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data. Quality was assessed using QUADAS-2, with StataMP 17 for meta-analysis. In this study, 422 articles were retrieved, and 7 were finally included for meta-analysis. The analysis showed that the accuracy of deep learning in the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 80%-98.9%, and the combined sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96), and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98).

40900780,Case Report: Multi-cancer early detection utilizing blood-based genomics: Single-institution case series of novel cancer screening.,"Cancer screening continues to be a major challenge, with reliable tests only being available for very few cancers. Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) genomic tests are being developed that allow for blood-based screening of multiple cancers simultaneously. The PATHFINDER study was a multi-institution prospective cohort study in healthy participants over the age of 50 years (no cancer history, or history of treated cancer > 3 years prior), investigating the feasibility of the Galleri (GRAIL, LLC) cfDNA methylation MCED blood test. For participants in which the Galleri MCED test revealed methylation signatures indicative of cancer, predicted cancer signal origins were provided to the clinicians to assist with further diagnostic workup. Our institution was the highest accruing site nationally. Here, we describe our institutional test performance and provide informative case vignettes. Under IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of participants enrolled in the PATHFINDER study was performed. Cancer risk factors, outcomes of tests and studies performed due to MCED signal positive, time to diagnostic resolution, and treatment outcomes were obtained from chart-review. From January 2020 to December 2020, our institution enrolled 1735 participants (26% of total study enrollment), 27 of which returned a signal positive for cancer suspicion (1.6%), and ultimately 12 diagnosed cancers (true positives) for a positive predictive value of 44%. Four of 12 were recurrent cancers in participants more than three years from cancer therapy. There were 15 signal positives without cancer diagnoses (false positives), with one patient receiving extensive work-up for possible uterus, breast or lung cancer origin. Six of 15 false positive results correlated to monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (chronic lymphocytic leukemia precursor). During the course of 12-month follow-up for signal negatives, 19 additional participants were diagnosed with a cancer (sensitivity: 39%, specificity: 99.1%). Our institutional experience demonstrates the feasibility of MCED testing. Additional prospective randomized clinical trials are needed before widespread adoption.

The incorporation of technologies such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) in increasingly younger patients has accelerated the transition toward precision medicine. This retrospective cross-sectional study (January 2021-June 2024) included 187 neonates (≤90 days old) from the NICUs of the Clínica Colsanitas network in Bogotá, Colombia and evaluate the diagnostic yield for genomic testing comprising 82 Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and 125 aCGH tests, with 18 patients undergoing both. This study also examined the phenotypic traits of patients to investigate potential associations with a higher diagnostic yield. Symptoms were characterized using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms and analyzed with a propagation algorithm for improved accuracy. The diagnostic yield was 30.5% for WES and 8% for aCGH. Noteworthy, we identify four novel SNVs with potential pathogenicity and report a rare case of co-occurring deletion and duplication, both previously unreported in the literature. Phenotypic analysis revealed a strong association between what were considered ""growth abnormalities"" related to intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and/or growth retardation, with ""head or neck abnormalities"" related to specific malformations of the face or head and/or dysmorphic facial phenotypes. These findings highlight the importance of applying, in particular, WES as a first-level clinical diagnostic test in patients with suspected genetic or complex diseases who are hospitalized in the NICU.

40909900,Study on the isolation of rhizosphere bacteria and the mechanism of growth promotion in winter wheat in response to drought stress.,"Wheat is one of the three major cereal crops in the world and is susceptible to the effects of drought stress. Rhizosphere microorganisms can affect plant growth by altering nutrient absorption and resistance to stress. Studying the plant-microbe interaction under drought stress to reveal the impact of soil microorganisms on plant growth in dry land has important scientific significance. In this study, seven plant growth-promoting bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of winter wheat, and their growth-promoting ability was compared and analyzed. The results indicate that these strains are capable of hydrolyzing organic and inorganic phosphorus, fixing nitrogen, producing IAA (indole-3-acetic acid), ACC deaminase, and iron siderophore. Combined with pot experiment data, <i>Microbacterium</i> sp. I2, <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp. R4, and <i>Microbacterium</i> sp. K2 can significantly promote wheat growth. Under normal conditions, the wheat plant height increased by 5.17%, 13.02%, and 12.14% compared to the control group after one month of treatment with I2, R4, and K2, respectively. Under drought stress, the plant height increased by 6.41%, 2.56%, and -3.46%, respectively. However, under drought stress, only K2 significantly increased wheat root length by 11.94% compared to the control group. Therefore, K2 has stronger drought resistance than I2 and R4. Genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis of I2, R4, and K2 strains revealed that the strains contain functional gene clusters related to phosphorus solubilization (<i>pstABCS, phoUR</i>), ACC deamination (<i>accABD</i>), iron transport (<i>fepCDG</i>), IAA production (<i>trpABC</i>), nitrogen fixation (<i>nifUHJ</i>), drought resistance (<i>ostAB, treXYZ</i>), but with different gene types and copy numbers. Compared to I2, the R4 genome lacks one copy of the <i>phoUR</i> gene cluster, ACC deaminase, and iron transport related functional gene clusters. The K2 genome contains both <i>treXYZ</i> and <i>ostAB</i> gene clusters, which may be associated with its significant improvement in plant drought resistance. This study indicates that PGPB may promote plant growth by affecting nutrient absorption and hormone synthesis, while also affecting plant drought resistance by regulating osmotic pressure and trehalose biosynthesis, providing a theoretical basis for regulation of plant growth in a sustainable way.","Zhang, Lijuan; Pan, Yanshuo; Qi, Yanjie; Bai, Jing; Han, Dongfei","Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China.; School of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.; School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Suzhou University of Science and Technology, Suzhou, China.",Frontiers in plant science,Front Plant Sci,,2025,08,19,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40909900,10.3389/fpls.2025.1595554,40909900,0,0,NONE

Given the role of the PP2C gene family in stress tolerance and the recent publication of the genome sequence of the modern polyploid sugarcane cultivar R570, this study conducted genome-wide identification and characterization of the PP2C gene family in sugarcane. The analysis includes genome-wide identification, phylogenetic analysis, gene structure, conserved motif and domain analysis, synteny analysis, evolutionary selection pressure (Ka/Ks) estimation, gene ontology annotation, and RT-qPCR based expression profiling of selected PP2C genes. A total of 500 PP2C genes were identified, distributed across all 10 chromosomes and their subgenomes. Phylogenetic analysis, using Arabidopsis, <i>S. spontaneum</i>, maize, and wheat as references, classified these genes into 13 subfamilies. The results showed that, similar to <i>S. spontaneum</i>, where the largest subfamily is F with 37 members, the largest subfamily in the sugarcane hybrid cultivar was also F, with 74 members, followed by subfamily A with 69 members. The exon and motif distribution were found to be highly conserved within the same subfamily. Tandem duplication was prominent, with 107 genes identified as paralogs, indicating their role in gene expansion. The chromosomal distribution of SoffiXPP2C genes was partially biased, as approximately 50% of the genes were located on chromosomes 1, 2, and 3, along with their respective subgenomes. Synteny analysis revealed a strong conservation of the protein phosphatase domain between modern hybrid and wild sugarcane (<i>S. spontaneum</i>). Additionally, the synteny association of SoffiXPP2C genes with two potential cold stress-responsive genes, SsPP2C27 and SsPP2C64, suggests a possible role of SoffiXPP2C genes in abiotic stress regulation. The observed downregulation of certain SoffiXPP2C genes in waterlogging-tolerant genotypes further supports their potential function as negative regulators, particularly under waterlogging stress conditions. The domain architecture analysis further emphasizes the multifaceted roles of sugarcane PP2Cs, particularly in stress signaling, protein phosphorylation regulation, and membrane-associated functions. Furthermore, the strong alignment of 34 SoffiXPP2C genes with differentially expressed contigs of sugarcane under oxidative stress conditions reinforces insights into the potential role of SoffiXPP2Cs in stress response. These findings provide valuable insights into the evolutionary conservation of PP2C genes in sugarcane hybrid cultivar and their critical role in abiotic stress responses.","Kumari, Shweta; Harshavardhini, R K; Murugan, Nandhini; Keerthana, S; Aispriya, NONE; Vinayaka, NONE; Ramaswamy, Anitha; Prabhakaran, Jeyakumar; Ramaswamy, Manimekalai","Department of Crop Physiology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.; Division of Crop Improvement, ICAR- Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.; Statistics & Economics Section, ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.; Department of Computer Science, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.",Frontiers in plant science,Front Plant Sci,,2025,08,19,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40904868,10.3389/fpls.2025.1596800,40904868,0,0,NONE
40838078,Enhancing wheat genomic prediction by a hybrid kernel approach.,"This study integrates genomic and pedigree data by leveraging advanced modeling techniques, aiming to enhance the predictive performance of genomic selection models by capturing complex genetic relationships through the interaction of both matrices and exploring the utility of non-linear methods, such as kernel matrices. Our goal was to improve genomic prediction accuracy by combining the pedigree-based or genetic similarity matrix ( <b><i>A</i></b> ) with the genomic similarity matrix ( <b><i>G</i></b> ). Using various wheat datasets, we performed five single-environment models and five multi-environment models that incorporated genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions. The proposed models S5 and M5 significantly enhanced prediction accuracy by incorporating two novel symmetric kernels, <b><i>C</i></b> and <b><i>P</i></b> , derived from the interaction of genomic and pedigree matrices. These hybrid kernels captured additional, independent genetic variation not explained by conventional matrices. The proposed prediction model outperformed the standard conventional models in most single-environment and multi-environment models.

40918955,Bridging micro and macroevolution: insights from chromosomal dynamics in plants.,"Understanding the relationship between macro- and microevolutionary processes and their delimitation remains a challenge. This review focuses on the role of chromosomal rearrangements in plant population differentiation and lineage diversification resulting in speciation, helping bridge the gap between macro- and microevolution through chromosomal evolution. We focus on angiosperms, a group that comprises the majority of extant plant species diversity and exhibits the largest chromosomal and genomic variations. Here, we address the following questions: Are macroevolutionary patterns of chromosome evolution the result of accumulated microevolutionary changes, or do chromosomal dynamics drive larger shifts along the speciation continuum? At the macroevolutionary level, we investigated the association between karyotype diversity and diversification rates using evidence from comparative genomics, chromosomal evolution modelling across phylogenies, and the association with several traits across different angiosperm lineages. At the microevolutionary level, we explore if different karyotypes are linked to morphological changes and population genetic differentiation in the same lineages. Polyploidy (autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy) and dysploidy are known drivers of speciation, with karyotypic differences often leading to reproductive barriers. We found that dysploidy, involving gains and losses of single chromosomes with no significant change in overall content of the genome, appears to be relatively more frequent and persistent across macroevolutionary histories than polyploidy. Additionally, chromosomal rearrangements that do not entail change in chromosome number, such as insertions, deletions, inversions, and duplications of chromosome fragments, as well as translocations between chromosomes, are increasingly recognized for their role in local adaptation and speciation. We argue that there is more evidence linking chromosomal rearrangements with genetic and morphological trait differentiation at microevolutionary scales than at macroevolutionary ones. Our findings highlight the importance of selection across evolutionary scales, where certain chromosomal dynamics become fixed over macroevolutionary time. Consequently, at microevolutionary scales, chromosome rearrangements are frequent and diverse, serving as key drivers of plant diversification and adaptation by providing a pool of variation from which beneficial chromosomal changes can be selected and fixed by evolutionary forces.","Benítez-Benítez, Carmen; Mohan, Ashwini V; Sánchez-Villegas, Rogelio; Gómez-Ramos, Inés; Valdés-Florido, Ana; Lucek, Kay; Slovák, Marek; Kolář, Filip; Leitch, Ilia J; Luceño, Modesto; Larridon, Isabel; Carta, Angelino; Cuscó-Borràs, Joan; Maguilla, Enrique; Montero-Ramírez, Alegría; Meirmans, Patrick G; Scott, Alison Dawn; Martín-Bravo, Santiago; Escudero, Marcial","Department of Biology, Botany Unit, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.; Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany, Průhonice, Czechia.; Biodiversity Genomics Laboratory, Institute of Biology, University of Neuchâtel, Neuchâtel, Switzerland.; Department of Microbial and Plant Interactions, Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany, Bratislava, Slovakia.; Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, United Kingdom.; Centre for Climate Change Impact (CIRSEC), University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.; Botany Area, Department of Plant Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Biology, University of Seville, Seville, Spain.; Department of Chromosome Biology, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany.; Botany Area, Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemical Engineering, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain.; Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED), Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",Frontiers in plant science,Front Plant Sci,,2025,08,22,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40918955,10.3389/fpls.2025.1606450,40918955,0,0,NONE
40831730,Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals the biosynthesis mechanism of dihydrochalcones in sweet tea (<i>Lithocarpus litseifolius</i>).,"The demand for plant-based, low-calorie natural sweeteners is increasing. Four dihydrochalcones (DHCs), namely phloretin, phlorizin, trilobatin, and sieboldin, have been identified in the leaves of <i>Lithocarpus litseifolius</i>. These compounds serve as natural flavor sweeteners with potential health-promoting effects. However, the biosynthetic pathways of these DHCs are not yet fully understood. In this study, the content of four DHCs was quantified using LC-MS/MS across five developmental stages (S1-S5) of <i>L. litseifolius</i> leaves. Our results revealed an accumulation pattern where DHC levels peaked at stage S3, followed by a sharp decrease at stages S4 and S5, with the exception of sieboldin, which maintained high levels. We elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway of DHCs, involving 82 candidate enzyme-encoding genes, including five <i>PALs</i>, three <i>C4Hs</i>, 13 <i>4CL</i>s, 18 <i>CDBRs</i>, five <i>CHSs</i>, 14 <i>P2'GTs</i>, 12 <i>P4'GTs</i>, nine <i>F3'Hs</i>, and three <i>CH3H</i>s, and found that either tandem duplication or proximal duplication may have contributed to the expansion of key genes such as <i>CDBR</i>, <i>P2'GT</i>, and <i>P4'GT</i>. Furthermore, we reconstructed 11 regulatory networks of DHCs, two modules were positively related to the contents of phloretin, phlorizin, and trilobatin (r = 0.54-0.69, <i>P</i> < 0.05), while two other modules were associated with sieboldin accumulation (r = 0.59-0.74, <i>P</i> < 0.05). We also identified <i>MYB</i>, <i>WD40</i>-like, <i>WRKY</i>, and <i>bHLH</i> transcription factors as potential regulators in the biosynthesis of four DHCs. We found two biosynthetic gene clusters of DHCs, including nine and four genes encoding <i>CDBR</i> and <i>P2'GT</i>, respectively. Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these two BGCs may have experienced independent evolutionary processes within the Fagaceae family. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the resource development and utilization of sweet tea.

40777654,A capacity strengthening model toward self-reliant and sustainable one-health workforce in six East African Community Partner States.,"The burden of infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Africa highlights the critical need for strengthened genomic surveillance capacities that are embedded within the national public health framework. In the East African Community (EAC), this challenge is compounded by limited infrastructure and insufficient workforce capacity in bioinformatics and genomics, particularly within National Public Health Laboratories (NPHLs). This paper describes the implementation of a regional capacity-building initiative based on a multi-phase Training-of-Trainers (ToT) model across six EAC Partner States. Anchored in a One Health framework, the initiative focused on equipping public health professionals within NPHLs with practical skills in pathogen genomics, AMR analysis, and bioinformatics workflows, while also supporting the institutionalization of standardized procedures and tools. Through modular training, in-country cascade sessions, and structured mentorship, the program enabled integration of genomic approaches into public health surveillance activities. Despite infrastructural and operational constraints, the initiative supported measurable gains in applied proficiency, routine use of genomics tools in surveillance tasks, and regional coordination on pathogen data analysis. This case study outlines the program's design, implementation, and observed outcomes, and offers a transferable framework for workforce and systems development in low-resource settings. This experience contributes to ongoing global discussions on equitable genomic surveillance and preparedness by demonstrating how structured, context-specific training can support sustainable adoption of genomics within national public health institutions.","Nguinkal, Julien A; Gehre, Florian; Lagu, Hakim I; Achol, Emmanuel; Nzeyimana, Eric; Kiiru, John N; Nyandwi, Joseph; Dumo, Gregory W; Moremi, Nyambura; Nabadda, Susan N; Mukagatare, Isabelle; Molina, Andrea; May, Jürgen; Affara, Muna","Biomedical Services Department, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, Kigali, Rwanda.; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany.; Department of Disease Surveillance and Epidemic Response, Ministry of Health, Nairobi, Kenya.; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Hamburg-Borstel-Lübeck-Riems, Hamburg, Germany.; National Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Juba, South Sudan.; National Reference Laboratory, National Institute of Public Health, Bujumbura, Burundi.; National Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.; Health Department, East African Community (EAC), Arusha, Tanzania.; Tropical Medicine II, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany.; Central Public Health Laboratories, National Health Laboratories, Ministry of Health, Kampala, Uganda.",Frontiers in public health,Front Public Health,"Capacity Building, Humans, Africa, Eastern, One Health, Public Health, Genomics, Computational Biology, East African People",2025,07,24,2025,08,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40777654,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1636817,40777654,0,,
40900699,Next generation sequencing as a panacea for antibiotic susceptibility testing: yea or nay?,"Practical next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are entering the high-throughput diagnostic clinical microbiology laboratory. Bacterial whole genome sequences (WGS) can be used for detection and identification of species and their (relative) quantification. Genomic relatedness and epidemiological spread of strains of microorganisms can be traced, in parallel with detection of virulence genes as well as genes involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The latter potentially facilitates genomic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (gAST). AMR mechanisms and the genes involved are diverse and require dedicated supporting databases in order to be accurately detected by microbial genomics. The present document assesses the current position of NGS and gAST assays in the clinical microbiology laboratory and discusses their role in establishing a clinically actionable antibiogram which defines the spectrum of antibiotics to which a given microbial strain is susceptible or resistant. Key question is whether or not gAST has added value as compared to current AST methodologies. Full diagnostic implementation of gAST in the routine medical microbiology laboratory is as yet impossible. The technical complexity of gAST still needs a significant decrease, gAST data management needs to be improved and simplified, the timeliness of the gAST assays requires improvement, and costs need to go down. The throughput of genomic testing for large-scale routine medical-microbiological testing needs to be enhanced. Its clinical value needs to be better defined and requirements for optimal market access and acceptance should be further developed. When forthcoming gAST has been shown to be compatible with insurance and reimbursement budgets as well as microbiological QA/QC assessment and has been through the European <i>In Vitro</i> Diagnostics Regulation (IVDR) accreditation and/or US FDA approval, only then a more significant future role for gAST can be carefully considered. We should avoid that bureaucracy impedes the development of sequence-based AMR assessment. To date, routine gAST cannot do without combining it with rapid phenotypic AST.","van Belkum, Alex","ShanX Medtech, Eindhoven, Netherlands.; Independent Researcher, Rijnsburg, Netherlands.",Frontiers in public health,Front Public Health,"High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Resistance, Bacterial",2025,08,18,2025,09,05,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40900699,10.3389/fpubh.2025.1650925,40900699,0,0,NONE
40822678,Advances in the application of multi-omics analysis in skin aging.,"Skin aging is a progressive decline in the structural integrity and physiological function of the skin, driven by a complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Consequently, skin aging is classified into intrinsic and extrinsic aging. Intrinsic aging is characterized by epidermal thinning, dryness, fine lines, and reduced elasticity over time, whereas extrinsic aging manifests as epidermal thickening, deep wrinkles, skin laxity, roughness, and pigmentation, particularly in sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, and hands. The underlying mechanisms of these two aging processes are intricate and distinct, encompassing various elements, including temporal aspects, genetic predisposition, immune responses, endocrine influences, and ultraviolet radiation. Multi-omics approaches-including macro-genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-offer valuable insights into the mechanisms and pathogenesis of skin aging while aiding in the identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

This reform, supported by the UK's Genomic Medical Services (GMS) through ""The Generation Study,"" aims to significantly reduce infant mortality by identifying and managing over 200 rare diseases from birth, paving the way for personalised health planning. Using an ecosystem approach, this study evaluates a diverse pangenome to predict health outcomes or confirm diagnoses prior to symptomatic manifestations. GNBS standardises care by integrating diagnostic techniques such as blood spot analysis and full blood cell diagnostics to stratify risk. The approach enhances the understanding of rare diseases in primary care medicine, with biomedical and haematology diagnoses re-evaluated. Scientific proof of concept and fit-for-purpose technology align multi-omics in pre-eXams (X = Gen AI).

This team strategically plans regulation services for digital HPO eXam assurance and implements Higher Expert Medical Science Safety (HEMSS) frameworks. The DRS is responsible for overseeing gene, oligonucleotide, and recombinant protein intercepts; commissioning blood pathology HPO eXam intercepts; and monitoring preliminary eXams with advanced imaging techniques. In pursuit of excellence in PHM of HPO, HEMSS with Agile Group Development leverages the Genomic Newborn Screens (GNBS) and multi-omics to create personalised health plans integrated with NHS England Genomics and AI-driven DRS.

40855856,Identification of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and co-transcriptional analysis of mRNAs and lncRNAs in transcriptomes of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>.,"<i>Anopheles gambiae</i> is a primary malaria vector mosquito in Africa. RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis has been widely used to study gene expressions underlying mosquito life traits such as development, reproduction, immunity, metabolism, and behavior. While it is widely appreciated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed ubiquitously in transcriptomes across metazoans, lncRNAs remain relatively underexplored in <i>An. gambiae</i>, including their identity, expression profiles, and biological functions. The lncRNA genes were poorly annotated in the current reference of the PEST genome of <i>An. gambiae</i>. In this study, a set of publicly available RNA-seq datasets was leveraged to identify lncRNAs across diverse contexts, including whole mosquitoes, mosquito cells or tissues including hemocytes, midguts, and salivary glands, as well as under different physiological conditions including sugar-feeding, blood-feeding, bacterial challenges, and <i>Plasmodium</i> infections. A Transcript Discovery module implemented in CLC genomics workbench was used to identify lncRNAs from selected published RNA-seq datasets. Across this pool of transcriptomes, 2684 unique lncRNA genes, comprising 4082 transcripts, were identified. Following their identification, these lncRNA genes were integrated into the mosquito transcriptome annotation, which was then used as a reference to analyze both mRNAs and lncRNAs for transcriptional dynamics in different conditions. Unsurprisingly and similar to what has been reported for mRNAs, lncRNAs exhibited context-dependent expression patterns. Co-expression networks constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) highlighted the interconnections among lncRNAs and mRNAs, which provides potential functional networks in which these lncRNAs are involved. Furthermore, we identified polysome-associated lncRNAs within polysome-captured transcripts, suggesting the involvement of lncRNAs in translation regulation and coding capacity for micropeptides. The analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset unveiled a correlation of transcriptional activities between lncRNAs and observed epigenetic signatures. Overall, our study demonstrated that lncRNAs are transcribed alongside mRNAs in various biological contexts. The genome-wide annotation of lncRNA genes and integration into the PEST reference genome enables the co-analysis of mRNA and lncRNA simultaneously, which will enhance our understanding of their functions, shedding light on their regulatory roles in <i>An. gambiae</i> biology.","Xu, Jiannong; Hu, Kai; Riehle, Michelle M; Khadka, Vedbar S","Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, John A.

40809118,Elucidating a genomic signature associated with behavioral and executive function after moderate to severe pediatric TBI: a systems biology informed approach.,"<b>Introduction:</b> There is significant unexplained variability in behavioral and executive functioning after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prior research indicates that there are likely genetic contributions; however, current research is limited. The purpose of this study is to use a systems biology informed approach to characterize the genomic signature related to behavioral and executive functioning ∼12 months after moderate through severe TBI in children. <b>Methods:</b> Participants were from two prospective cohorts of children with severe TBI (Cohort #1) and moderate-severe TBI and an orthopedic injury (OI) group (Cohort #2). Participants included 196 children (<i>n</i> = 72 and <i>n</i> = 124 total from each respective cohort), ranging in age between 0-17 years at the time of injury. In total, 86 children had severe TBI, 49 had moderate TBI, and 61 had an OI. Global behavioral functioning assessed via the Child Behavior Checklist and executive function assessed via the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function at ∼ 12 months post injury served as outcomes. To test for a genomic signature, we compared the number of nominally significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) polymorphisms associated with the outcomes in our systems biology identified genes to a set 10,000 permutations using control genes (e.g., not implicated by systems biology). We used the ToppFun application from Toppgene Suite to identify enriched biologic processes likely to be associated with behavioral and executive function outcomes. <b>Results:</b> At 12 months post injury, injury type (TBI vs OI) by polymorphism interaction was significantly enriched in systems biology selected genes for behavioral and executive function outcomes, suggesting these genes form a genomic signature. Effect sizes of the associations from our genes of interest ranged from .2-.5 for the top 5% of variants. Systems biology analysis of the variants associated with the top 5% effect sizes indicated enrichment in several specific biologic processes and systems. <b>Discussion:</b> Findings indicate that a genomic signature may explain heterogeneity of behavioral and executive outcomes after moderate and severe TBI. This work provides the foundation for constructing genomic signatures and integrating systems biology and genetic information into future recovery, prognostic, and treatment algorithms.","Kurowski, Brad G; Treble-Barna, Amery; Pilipenko, Valentina; Martin, Lisa J; Jegga, Anil G; Miley, Aimee E; Zhang, Nanhua; Fabio, Anthony; Chima, Ranjit S; Adlam, Anna-Lynne R; Kaufman, Kenneth; Bell, Michael J; Beers, Sue R; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Wade, Shari L; NONE, NONE","Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, Epidemiology Data Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Cincinnati Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC, United States.; Division of Critical Care Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurological Surgery, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.; Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Psychology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, United States.; Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, United States.",Frontiers in systems biology,Front Syst Biol,,2024,04,25,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40809118,10.3389/fsysb.2024.1293265,40809118,0,,
40809134,Transporter annotations are holding up progress in metabolic modeling.,"Mechanistic, constraint-based models of microbial isolates or communities are a staple in the metabolic analysis toolbox, but predictions about microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions are only as good as the accuracy of transporter annotations. A number of hurdles stand in the way of comprehensive functional assignments for membrane transporters. These include general or non-specific substrate assignments, ambiguity in the localization, directionality and reversibility of a transporter, and the many-to-many mapping of substrates, transporters and genes. In this perspective, we summarize progress in both experimental and computational approaches used to determine the function of transporters and consider paths forward that integrate both. Investment in accurate, high-throughput functional characterization is needed to train the next-generation of predictive tools toward genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions that better predict phenotypes and interactions. More reliable predictions in this domain will benefit fields ranging from personalized medicine to metabolic engineering to microbial ecology.","Casey, John; Bennion, Brian; D'haeseleer, Patrik; Kimbrel, Jeffrey; Marschmann, Gianna; Navid, Ali","Earth and Environmental Sciences, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, United States.; Systems and Synthetic Biology Group, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States.; Biochemical and Biophysical Systems Group, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States.",Frontiers in systems biology,Front Syst Biol,,2024,07,24,2025,08,16,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40809134,10.3389/fsysb.2024.1394084,40809134,2,,"[40670725, 39005317]"
40895792,Insights from metagenomics on microbial biosynthesis of vitamins B and K<sub>2</sub> in chicken gut microbiota.,"The chicken gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in nutrient absorption and overall health, contributing to the biosynthesis of essential vitamins. However, the biosynthesis of vitamins B and K<sub>2</sub> by the whole gut microbiome, as well as their abundances across different gut regions, remains largely unknown. We employed both metagenomic sequencing and culture-based techniques, collecting a total of 25,825 genomes (25,764 metagenome-assembled genomes and 61 isolated genomes). After quality assessment and average nucleotide identity (ANI), 13,734 genomes were retained for downstream analysis. Whole-genome clustering analysis identified 2,675 species-level genome bins (SGBs), predominantly from the phyla <i>Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Pseudomonadota,</i> and <i>Actinomycetota</i>. A gene catalog comprising 9.69 million genes revealed that 195,517 genes are involved in the biosynthesis of vitamins B and K<sub>2</sub>, exhibiting significant regional variation. The large intestine exhibited greater species richness and evenness compared to the small intestine. From the 13,734 genomes, we discovered 3,063 high-quality ones capable of synthesizing at least one vitamin. Genomic analysis revealed that a mere 8.2% of genomes were capable of producing five or more vitamins, while almost half were limited to synthesizing just one. Comparative genomics of cobalamin (B<sub>12</sub>) biosynthesis highlighted the predominance of the anaerobic pathway. Additionally, changes in microbial abundance were observed, such as increased abundance of the genera <i>Phocaeicola</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> during bacterial infections, and <i>Limisoma</i> during parasitic infections. This study provides detailed metagenomic insights into the capacity of chicken gut microbiome for vitamins B and K<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis, revealing significant regional and taxonomic variations. These results suggest a collaborative microbial effort in vitamin biosynthesis, with potential implications for optimizing poultry health and nutrition through targeted microbial interventions.","Yu, Hai-Long; Hou, Xin-Wen; Zhao, Ji-Xin; Liu, Guo-Hua; Meng, Jin-Xin; Wei, Yong-Jie; Cai, Yanan; Liu, Jian; Shang, Kai-Meng; Ni, Hong-Bo; Liu, Rui; Ma, He; Nan, Fu-Long; Zhang, Xiao-Xuan; Chen, Bei-Ni; Yang, Xing","College of Veterinary Medicine, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, Shandong Province, China.; Research Center for Parasites and Vectors, College of Veterinary Medicine, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.; Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan Province, China.; College of Veterinary Medicine, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.",Frontiers in veterinary science,Front Vet Sci,,2025,08,14,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40895792,10.3389/fvets.2025.1646825,40895792,0,0,NONE

Herein, we characterized a <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub>-harbouring <i>P. mirabilis</i> strain recovered from Greece (Pm GR-1), while phylogenomics and comparative genomics analyses with previously published <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> carriers were also assessed. <b>Methods</b>: Characterization of Pm GR-1 was performed by the Vitek<sup>®</sup> Compact and Mass Spectrometry systems, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of beta-lactamases, multilocus-sequence typing (MLST), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In silico prediction of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), genomic islands (GIs), antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs), and phylogenetic, core-genome SNP and comparative genomics analyses were executed using bioinformatic tools. <b>Results</b>: Pm GR-1 was isolated from a urine sample of an outpatient in a Greek hospital. It exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype, being susceptible only to amikacin and ceftazidime/avibactam. It co-carried several beta-lactamase genes on the chromosome (<i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-14</sub>, <i>bla</i><sub>TEM-1</sub>) and a plasmid <i>(bla</i><sub>TEM-2</sub>) and several other ARGs, but also mutations associated with quinolone resistance in the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV subunits. It belonged to the international clone ST135 that has also been detected among OXA-48-producing <i>P. mirabilis</i> strains from Germany and the USA. Pm GR-1 was genetically related to those from Germany, sharing highly similar MGEs, GIs, ARGs and VFs, including the chromosomal <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> genetic structure, the O-antigen locus, the flagella locus, the MR/P fimbriae operon, and the urease gene cluster. <b>Conclusions</b>: To our knowledge, this is the first report from Greece of a <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub>-possessing <i>P. mirabilis</i> strain.

40893415,"Gallium Resistance in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>: Polymorphisms and Morphology Impacting Growth in Metals, Antibiotics and Polyfluorinated Compounds.","The imminent threat of antibiotic resistance has spurred studies of nonconventional antimicrobial approaches. Gallium utilization is a promising and emerging approach to treating a variety of resistant bacteria using ""Trojan horse"" strategies to disrupt iron-dependent processes and biofilms. This study utilized experimental evolution to test the evolvability of gallium resistance in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and resistance traits potentially correlated with metals, antibiotics and polyfluorinated compounds, as well as its genomics foundations. Whole-genome sequencing was utilized to reveal functional networks of mutations associated with gallium resistance. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation was utilized to visualize distinct morphological changes on the surface of gallium-resistant populations and compare with the control populations. As demonstrated by these studies, <i>S. aureus</i> evolved resistance to gallium after 20 days of selection. Furthermore, these populations displayed resistance traits correlated with heavy metals and polyfluorinated compounds. In contrast, the gallium-resistant populations were very sensitive to antibiotics. Whole-genome analysis revealed significant polymorphisms in the gallium (III)-resistant populations for example, polymorphisms in staphyloferrinA export MFS transporter/D ornithine citrate ligase (<i>sfaA/sfaD</i>), teichoic acid D Ala esterase (<i>fmtA</i>), DUF3169 family protein (<i>KQ76_RS01520</i>) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (<i>KQ76_RS08360</i>), while polymorphisms in the ABC transporter permease subunit (<i>pstC</i>) and acyltransferase family protein (<i>KQ76_RS04365</i>) were unique to the control populations. The polymorphisms directly affected the cells' morphology. SEM images showed significant external ultrastructural changes in the gallium-selected bacterial cells compared to the control cells.

Deep learning methods have become popular in single cell analysis for tasks such as dimension reduction, cell clustering, and data imputation. In this work, we introduce DropDAE, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) model enhanced with contrastive learning, to specifically address the dropout events in scRNA-seq data, where certain genes show very low or even zero expression levels due to technical limitations. DropDAE uses the architecture of a denoising autoencoder to recover the underlying data patterns while leveraging contrastive learning to enhance group separation. Our extensive evaluations across multiple simulation settings based on synthetic data and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DropDAE not only reconstructs data effectively but also further improves clustering performance, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.","Juan, Wanlin; Ahn, Kwang Woo; Chen, Yi-Guang; Lin, Chien-Wei","Division of Biostatistics, Data Science Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",Bioengineering (Basel),,2025,07,31,2025,09,14,U24 CA076518_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; U24CA076518_NONE_US National Cancer Institute_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40868342,10.3390/bioengineering12080829,40868342,0,0,NONE

Thus, this species is generally considered of significant ecological, medical, and forensic importance. However, without a high-quality pseudo-chromosome genome for <i>C. megacephala</i>, elucidating its evolutionary trajectory proved difficult. Herein, we assembled and analyzed a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of the <i>C. megacephala</i>, combined with PacBio HiFi long reads, Hi-C data, and Illumina reads. The pseudo-chromosomes assembly of <i>C. megacephala</i> spans 629.44 Mb, with 97.05% anchored to five chromosomes. Final assembly includes 1056 contigs (N50 = 1.68 Mb), and 97 scaffolds (N50 = 121.37 Mb), achieving 98.90% BUSCO completeness (<i>n</i> = 1367). Gene annotation predicted 17,071 protein-coding genes (95.60% BUSCO completeness), while repeat masking identified 244.26 Mb (38.82%) as repetitive elements. Additionally, 3740 non-coding RNAs were characterized. Gene family analyses resulted in 10,579 gene families, containing 151 gene families that experienced rapid evolution. Comparative genomic analyses showed that the expanded genes are related to reproduction and necrophagous habits. In addition, we annotated the gene family P450s, CCEs, IRs, GRs, and ORs, all of which represent remarkable expansion, playing a crucial role in the mechanism of locating the hosts for forensic insects.

This study systematically reviews the role of bioinformation technology in eDNA analysis, focusing on methodologies and applications across air, soil, groundwater, sediment, and aquatic environments. Advances in molecular biology, high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics tools, and field-deployable detection systems have significantly improved eDNA detection sensitivity, allowing for early identification of invasive species, monitoring ecosystem health, and tracking pollutant degradation processes. Airborne eDNA monitoring has demonstrated potential for assessing microbial shifts due to air pollution and tracking pathogen transmission. In terrestrial environments, eDNA facilitates soil and groundwater pollution assessments and enhances understanding of biodegradation processes. In aquatic ecosystems, eDNA serves as a powerful tool for biodiversity assessment, invasive species monitoring, and wastewater-based epidemiology. Despite its growing applicability, challenges remain, including DNA degradation, contamination risks, and standardization of sampling protocols.

40843779,Impact of Cattle Breed in scRNA-Seq Reference on Muscle Fiber Type Deconvolution from Bulk RNA-Seq: A Comparison of Software Tools.,"While bulk RNA sequencing provides a comprehensive view of transcriptomes, it lacks cell type specificity. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) overcomes this limitation by providing detailed insights at the individual cell level, though it involves higher costs. Deconvolution methods can estimate cell type proportions in bulk RNA-seq data, but their results may vary based on the scRNA-seq reference data and software used. This study investigates the estimation of muscle fiber type proportions through deconvolution analysis of <i>Longissimus dorsi</i> muscle bulk RNA-seq data from late-gestation Holstein Friesian multiparous cows. Four software tools (i.e., CIBERSORTx, Cellanneal, DeconvR-NNLS, and DeconvR-RLM) were compared using scRNA-seq reference data from Brahman and Wagyu cattle breeds, which included proportions of types I, IIa, and IIx myofibers. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests revealed that the breed of reference data significantly influenced the proportions of type IIa and IIx muscle fibers across different deconvolution methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the cattle breed used in reference scRNA-seq data can substantially impact deconvolution outcomes, highlighting a critical consideration for accurate cell type proportion estimation in livestock genomics. These findings suggest that future deconvolution studies should carefully consider breed compatibility between reference and target datasets.","Moreira, Raphael P; Vicari, Marcelo R; Mulim, Henrique A; Casey, Theresa M; Boerman, Jacquelyn; Fu, Xing; Oliveira, Hinayah R","Graduate Program in Genetics, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba 81531-980, PR, Brazil.; Department of Structural Biology, Molecular and Genetics, State University of Ponta Grossa, Ponta Grossa 84030-000, PR, Brazil.; School of Animal Science, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.; Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.",Biotech (Basel (Switzerland)),BioTech (Basel),,2025,07,25,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40843779,10.3390/biotech14030056,40843779,0,0,NONE
40805180,Scaling for African Inclusion in High-Throughput Whole Cancer Genome Bioinformatic Workflows.,"Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing the highest mortality rates for several cancer types. While cancer research globally has entered the genomic era and advanced the deployment of precision oncology, Africa has largely been excluded and has received few benefits from tumour profiling. Through a thorough literature review, we identified only five whole cancer genome databases that include patients from Sub-Saharan Africa, covering four cancer types (breast, esophageal, prostate, and Burkitt lymphoma). Irrespective of cancer type, these studies report higher tumour genome instability, including African-specific cancer drivers and mutational signatures, suggesting unique contributory mechanisms at play. Reviewing bioinformatic tools applied to African databases, we carefully select a workflow suitable for large-scale African resources, which incorporates cohort-level data and a scalable design for time and computational efficiency. Using African genomic data, we demonstrate the scalability achieved by high-level parallelism through physical data or genomic interval chunking strategies. Furthermore, we provide a rationale for improving current workflows for African data, including the adoption of more genomic techniques and the prioritisation of African-derived datasets for diverse applications. Together, these enhancements and genomic scaling strategies serve as practical computational guidance, lowering technical barriers for future large-scale African-inclusive research and ultimately helping to reduce the disparity gap in cancer mortality rates across Sub-Saharan Africa.","Jiang, Jue; Samaha, Georgina; Willet, Cali E; Chew, Tracy; Hayes, Vanessa M; Jaratlerdsiri, Weerachai","Manchester Cancer Research Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4GJ, UK.; Computational Genomics Group, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.; Sydney Informatics Hub, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.; Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK.; Ancestry and Health Genomics Laboratory, Charles Perkins Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.; School of Health Systems and Public Health, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa.",Cancers,Cancers (Basel),,2025,07,26,2025,08,17,"Chair to Hayes_NONE_Petre Foundation Australia_; PC200390, PC210168, PC23067_NONE_Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) Prostate Cancer Research Program (PCRP)_; 1R01CA285772-24_NH_NIH HHS_United States; 2023CHAL4150_NONE_Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF)_; 2018/GNT1165762, 2020/GNT2001098, 2021/GNT2010551, 2024/GNT2037298_NONE_National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40805180,10.3390/cancers17152481,40805180,0,,
40867323,Spatially Encoded Oncogenesis and Transcriptional Plasticity in Meningioma: Drivers of Therapeutic Resistance and Opportunities for Targeted Intervention.,"Whilst typically benign, a subset of meningiomas displays aggressive and recurrent behavior. There is a paucity of reliable treatment options for this subset of patients and a relative lack of consensus on how to best manage these patients. This clinical challenge reflects underlying molecular complexity, driven by <i>NF2</i>, <i>TRAF7</i>, and <i>CDKN2A/B</i> mutations alongside pervasive epigenetic dysregulation. High-throughput molecular profiling studies have proposed biologically distinct meningioma subgroups with varying clinical trajectories and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Distinct cell lineages of meningeal precursors are now appreciated to be essential in the establishment of the meninges. The numerous cellular lineages involved in meningeal development, the heterogeneity of meningioma location and (epi)genomic behavior, and the variability in its clinical and radiological manifestations raise the question of what critical insights can be gained by understanding meningeal development during embryogenesis to understand meningioma tumorigenicity. The current paper examines this paradigm by highlighting spatially linked mechanisms of anaplasia and treatment resistance, including the role of neural crest-derived convexity meninges in promoting dedifferentiation via YAP/TAZ signaling and mesoderm-derived skull base regions in maintaining <i>TRAF7</i>-mediated vulnerabilities. We further elucidate the emerging synthetic lethal paradigms, CRISPR-enabled target discovery, and PROTAC-mediated degradation strategies that may transform the therapeutic landscape of clinically challenging meningiomas driven by complex oncogenic circuitry. By bridging embryogenesis, spatial genomics, and molecular targeting, we propose a developmentally informed, lineage-stratified model for advancing precision therapeutics in high-grade and recurrent meningiomas.","Abikenari, Matthew A; Regev, Amit; Bergsneider, Brandon H; Himic, Vratko; Annagiri, Shreyas; Kim, Lily H; Medikonda, Ravi; Choi, John; Jeyaretna, Sanjeeva; Fountain, Daniel M; Lim, Michael","Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.; MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, UK.; Department of Neurosurgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.; Department of Neurological Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, UK.",Cancers,Cancers (Basel),,2025,08,19,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40867323,10.3390/cancers17162694,40867323,0,0,NONE
40864753,Towards Personalized Precision Oncology: A Feasibility Study of NGS-Based Variant Analysis of FFPE CRC Samples in a Chilean Public Health System Laboratory.,"Massively parallel or next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the genetic characterization of cancer patients, allowing the identification of somatic and germline variants associated with their diagnosis, tumor classification, and therapy response. Despite its benefits, NGS testing is not yet available in the Chilean public health system, rendering it both costly and time-consuming for patients and clinicians. Using a retrospective cohort of 67 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, we aimed to implement the identification, annotation, and prioritization of relevant actionable tumor somatic variants in our laboratory, as part of the public health system. We compared two different library preparation methodologies (amplicon-based and capture-based) and different bioinformatics pipelines for sequencing analysis to assess advantages and disadvantages of each one. We obtained 80.5% concordance between actionable variants detected in our analysis and those obtained in the Cancer Genomics Laboratory from the Universidad de Chile (62 out of 77 variants), a validated laboratory for this methodology. Notably, 98.4% (61 out of 62) of variants detected previously by the validated laboratory were also identified in our analysis. Then, comparing the hybridization capture-based library preparation methodology with the amplicon-based strategy, we found ~94% concordance between identified actionable variants across the 15 shared genes, analyzed by the TumorSec<sup>TM</sup> bioinformatics pipeline, developed by the Cancer Genomics Laboratory. Our results demonstrate that it is entirely viable to implement an NGS-based analysis of actionable variant identification and prioritization in cancer samples in our laboratory, being part of the Chilean public health system and paving the way to improve the access to such analyses. Considering the economic realities of most Latin American countries, using a small NGS panel, such as TumorSec<sup>TM</sup>, focused on relevant variants of the Chilean and Latin American population is a cost-effective approach to extensive global NGS panels. Furthermore, the incorporation of automated bioinformatics analysis in this streamlined assay holds the potential of facilitating the implementation of precision medicine in this geographic region, which aims to greatly support personalized treatment of cancer patients in Chile.","Durán-Jara, Eduardo; Ponce, Iván; Rojas-Herrera, Marcelo; Toro, Jessica; Covarrubias, Paulo; González, Evelin; Santis-Alay, Natalia T; Soto-Marchant, Mario E; Marcelain, Katherine; Parra, Bárbara; Fernández, Jorge","Centro para la Prevención y el Control del Cáncer (CECAN), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Av.

40870862,Exome Sequencing in Adults with Unexplained Liver Disease: Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Impact.,"<b>Background:</b> The etiology of liver disease remains unidentified in approximately 30% of patients, presenting a persistent diagnostic challenge. While whole-exome sequencing (WES) is well established for identifying rare genetic conditions in pediatric populations, its utility in adult hepatology is less defined. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of WES in adults with unexplained liver disorder. <b>Methods:</b> Fifty-three Turkish adult patients with idiopathic liver disease underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation and WES at Gazi University Ankara in 2024-2025. The cohort included individuals with idiopathic cholestasis (6/53, 11%), hepatic steatosis (28/53, 53%), unexplained elevated liver enzymes (12/53, 23%), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (7/53, 13%). All patients had inconclusive results from prior standard investigations. <b>Results:</b> ES yielded a definitive molecular diagnosis in 11% (6/53) of cases. Definitive diagnoses were distributed across the following disease categories: idiopathic cholestasis (<i>n</i> = 1), hepatic steatosis (<i>n</i> = 1), elevated liver enzymes (<i>n</i> = 2), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (<i>n</i> = 2). Pathogenic variants were detected in the <i>ABCB4</i>, <i>AGL</i>, <i>APOB</i>, <i>CP</i>, and <i>MTTP</i> genes. One patient was identified with mosaic Turner syndrome. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the role of rare genetic variants in the etiology of unexplained liver disease in adults. Integrating whole-exome sequencing into hepatology practice can uncover novel disease mechanisms and improve diagnostic yield, informing more precise patient care.","Moral, Kenan; Kayhan, Gülsüm; Duzenli, Tarik; Sari, Sinan; Cindoruk, Mehmet; Ekmen, Nergiz","Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Pediatrics, Gazi University, Ankara 06560, Turkey.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara 06560, Turkey.; Department of Medical Genetics, Gazi University, Ankara 06560, Turkey.; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA 8035, USA.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",Diagnostics (Basel),,2025,08,11,2025,09,14,TGA-2024-9494_NONE_Gazi University Scientific Research Project Coordination Unit_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40870862,10.3390/diagnostics15162010,40870862,0,0,NONE
40870883,Discovery of <i>ETS1</i> as a New Gene Predisposing to Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), defined as dilation and contractile dysfunction of the left or both cardiac ventricles, remains the most common category of primary myocardial disease worldwide. It is the most prevalent cause of chronic heart failure and the most common indication for cardiac transplantation in young subjects. Accumulating evidence increasingly highlights the substantial genetic defects underlying DCM. Nevertheless, the genetic ingredients accountable for DCM in a major percentage of patients remain indefinite. <b>Methods:</b> A multigenerational pedigree suffering from DCM and a total of 276 healthy volunteers employed as controls were recruited from the Chinese Han-ethnicity population. A whole-exome sequencing (WES) assay followed by a Sanger sequencing analysis of the genomic DNAs from the available family members was implemented. Functional characterization of the identified genetic variant was completed by dual-luciferase analysis. <b>Results:</b> A new heterozygous variation in the <i>ETS1</i> (erythroblast transformation-specific 1) gene, NM_005238.4:c.447T>G;p.(Tyr149*), was identified by WES and validated by Sanger sequencing analysis to co-segregate with DCM in the whole DCM family. This nonsense <i>ETS1</i> variant was not found in 276 control subjects. Functional examination elucidated that Tyr149*-mutant ETS1 lost the ability to transactivate its downstream target genes <i>CLDN5</i> (claudin 5) and <i>ALK1</i> (activin receptor-like kinase 1), two genes crucial for cardiovascular embryonic development and postnatal structural remodeling. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present investigation reveals <i>ETS1</i> as a new gene predisposed to human DCM and indicates <i>ETS1</i> haploinsufficiency as an alternative molecular pathogenesis underlying DCM, providing a potential molecular target for genetic counseling and early diagnosis as well as personalized prophylaxis of DCM.","Ke, Zun-Ping; Gu, Jia-Ning; Yang, Chen-Xi; Li, Xue-Lin; Zou, Su; Bian, Yi-Zhe; Xu, Ying-Jia; Yang, Yi-Qing","Department of Geriatrics, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, China.; Department of Central Laboratory, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Research Laboratory, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, China.; Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, China.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",Diagnostics (Basel),,2025,08,13,2025,09,15,"2024MHZ015_NONE_The Natural Science Foundation of Minhang District, Shanghai, China_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40870883,10.3390/diagnostics15162031,40870883,0,0,NONE

40869898,"Exploring Cloned Disease Resistance Gene Homologues and Resistance Gene Analogues in <i>Brassica nigra</i>, <i>Sinapis arvensis</i>, and <i>Sinapis alba</i>: Identification, Characterisation, Distribution, and Evolution.","This study identifies and classifies resistance gene analogues (RGAs) in the genomes of <i>Brassica nigra</i>, <i>Sinapis arvensis</i> and <i>Sinapis alba</i> using the RGAugury pipeline. RGAs were categorised into four main classes: receptor-like kinases (RLKs), receptor-like proteins (RLPs), nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins and transmembrane-coiled-coil (TM-CC) genes. A total of 4499 candidate RGAs were detected, with species-specific proportions. RLKs were the most abundant across all genomes, followed by TM-CCs and RLPs. The sub-classification of RLKs and RLPs identified LRR-RLKs, LRR-RLPs, LysM-RLKs, and LysM-RLPs. Atypical NLRs were more frequent than typical ones in all species. Atypical NLRs were more frequent than typical ones in all species. We explored the relationship between chromosome size and RGA count using regression analysis. In <i>B. nigra</i> and <i>S. arvensis</i>, larger chromosomes generally harboured more RGAs, while <i>S. alba</i> displayed the opposite trend. Exceptions were observed in all species, where some larger chromosomes contained fewer RGAs in <i>B. nigra</i> and <i>S. arvensis</i>, or more RGAs in <i>S. alba</i>. The distribution and density of RGAs across chromosomes were examined. RGA distribution was skewed towards chromosomal ends, with patterns differing across RGA types. Sequence hierarchical pairwise similarity analysis revealed distinct gene clusters, suggesting evolutionary relationships. The study also identified homologous genes among RGAs and non-RGAs in each species, providing insights into disease resistance mechanisms. Finally, RLKs and RLPs were co-localised with reported disease resistance loci in <i>Brassica,</i> indicating significant associations. Phylogenetic analysis of cloned RGAs and QTL-mapped RLKs and RLPs identified distinct clusters, enhancing our understanding of their evolutionary trajectories.

40869921,Prenatal Rare 16q24.1 Deletion Between Genomics and Epigenetics: A Review.,"Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a rare, often fatal congenital disorder characterized by severe neonatal respiratory distress and associated with complex multisystem malformations. In approximately 90% of cases, the condition is linked to deletions or mutations affecting the <i>FOXF1</i> gene or its upstream enhancer region on chromosome 16q24.1. This review analyzes reported prenatal cases with 16q24.1 deletion involving <i>FOXF1</i>, aiming to identify recurrent sonographic features and elucidate the underlying genomic and epigenetic mechanisms. We reviewed prenatal cases reported in the literature involving deletions of the 16q24.1 region, including the <i>FOXF1</i> gene. Here, we expand the case series by reporting a fetus with increased nuchal translucency measuring 8 mm and a de novo 16q24.1 deletion. We identified nine prenatal cases with a 16q24.1 deletion, all involving the <i>FOXF1</i> gene or its enhancer region. The main ultrasound findings included increased nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma during the first trimester, and cardiac, renal, and intestinal malformations from 20 weeks of gestation onward. Prenatal diagnosis of ACDMPV based solely on ultrasound findings is challenging. In most reported cases, the pregnancy was carried to term, with the diagnosis being confirmed by post-mortem histopathological examination. In the only case in which the pregnancy was terminated at 14 weeks' gestation, histological examination of the fetal lungs, despite them being in the early stages of development, revealed misaligned pulmonary veins in close proximity to the pulmonary arteries and bronchioles. Evidence highlights the significance of non-coding regulatory regions in the regulation of <i>FOXF1</i> expression. Differential methylation patterns, and possible contributions of parental imprinting, highlight the complexity of <i>FOXF1</i> regulation. Early detection through array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) or next-generation sequencing to identify point mutations in the <i>FOXF1</i> gene, combined with increased awareness of ultrasound markers suggestive of the condition, could improve the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. Further research into the epigenetic regulation of <i>FOXF1</i> is crucial for refining recurrence risk estimates and improving genetic counseling practices.","Fumini, Valentina; Bonora, Romina; Busciglio, Anna; Cartisano, Francesca; Celli, Paola; Gabbiato, Ilaria; Guercini, Nicola; Mancini, Barbara; Saccilotto, Donatella; Zilio, Anna; Zuccarello, Daniela","Medical Genetics and Genomic Unit, San Bortolo Hospital, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Humans, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16, Forkhead Transcription Factors, Female, Pregnancy, Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome, Chromosome Deletion, Epigenesis, Genetic, Prenatal Diagnosis, Genomics, Ultrasonography, Prenatal, Pulmonary Veins, Pulmonary Alveoli",2025,07,24,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869921,10.3390/genes16080873,,,,
40869931,Genomics in Pancreas-Kidney Transplantation: From Risk Stratification to Personalized Medicine.,"<b>Background:</b> Pancreas and pancreas-kidney transplantation are well-established therapeutic options for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), offering the potential to restore endogenous insulin production and kidney function. It improves metabolic control, quality of life, and long-term survival. While surgical techniques and immunosuppressive strategies have advanced considerably, graft rejection and limited long-term graft survival remain significant clinical challenges. <b>Method:</b> To better understand these risks, the genetic and immunological factors that influence transplant outcomes are examined. Beyond traditional human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, non-HLA genetic variants such as gene deletions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have emerged as contributors to alloimmune activation and graft failure. <b>Result:</b> Polymorphisms in cytokine genes, minor histocompatibility antigens, and immune-regulatory pathways have been implicated in transplant outcomes. However, the integration of such genomic data into clinical practice remains limited due to underexplored gene targets, variability in study results, and the lack of large, diverse, and well-characterized patient cohorts. Initiatives like the International Genetics & Translational Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN) are addressing these limitations by aggregating genome-wide data from thousands of transplant donors and recipients across multiple centers. These large-scale collaborative efforts aim to identify clinically actionable genetic markers and support the development of personalized immunosuppressive strategies. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, genetic testing and genomics hold great promise in advancing precision medicine in pancreas and pancreas-kidney transplantation.","Aypek, Hande; Aygormez, Ozan; Caliskan, Yasar","Division of Nephrology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul 34093, Türkiye.; Division of Nephrology, Bursa Uludag University School of Medicine, Bursa 16059, Türkiye.; Division of Abdominal Transplant, SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital, Saint Louis, MO 63104, USA.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Humans, Kidney Transplantation, Pancreas Transplantation, Precision Medicine, Genomics, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Risk Assessment, Graft Rejection, Graft Survival, HLA Antigens, Kidney Failure, Chronic",2025,07,26,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869931,10.3390/genes16080884,,,,

40869955,Toward Precision Medicine: Molecular Biomarkers of Response to Tofacitinib in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition that significantly impairs the patient's quality of life. While biologics have transformed disease management, a substantial number of patients remain unresponsive or lose efficacy over time. Tofacitinib (TOFA), an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, introduces a novel therapeutic class of small-molecule drugs with a unique oral administration route, offering enhanced patient convenience and broader accessibility compared to parenterally administered biologics. As the first oral treatment approved for moderate to severe UC in years, TOFA acts by modulating the JAK/STAT pathway, influencing critical inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ. However, response rates are variable and appear dose-dependent, with up to 60% of patients showing inadequate therapeutic outcomes. This review represents the first comprehensive synthesis focused specifically on biomarkers of TOFA response in UC. Drawing on multi-omics data-epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and cellular profiling, we highlight emerging predictors of responsiveness, including CpG methylation signatures (e.g., <i>LRPAP1</i> and <i>FGFR2</i>), transcriptomic regulators (e.g., <i>REG3A</i> and <i>CLDN3</i>), immune and epithelial cell shifts, and the cationic transporter MATE1. TOFA demonstrates a dual mechanism by modulating immune responses while supporting epithelial barrier restoration. Despite being promising, TOFA's dose-dependent efficacy and interpatient variability underscore the critical need for non-invasive, predictive biomarkers to guide personalized treatment. As the first review of its kind, this work establishes a basis for precision medicine approaches to optimize the clinical utility of TOFA in UC management.","Bizjak, Anja; Gole, Boris; Jezernik, Gregor; Potočnik, Uroš; Gorenjak, Mario","Centre for Human Molecular Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Maribor, Taborska Ulica 8, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Humans, Pyrimidines, Precision Medicine, Piperidines, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Biomarkers, Pyrroles",2025,07,29,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869955,10.3390/genes16080908,,,,
40869967,Genomic Alterations and Microbiota Crosstalk in Hepatic Cancers: The Gut-Liver Axis in Tumorigenesis and Therapy.,"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Hepatic cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), are major global health concerns due to rising incidence and limited therapeutic success. While traditional risk factors include chronic liver disease and environmental exposures, recent evidence underscores the significance of genetic alterations and gut microbiota in liver cancer development and progression. This review aims to integrate emerging knowledge on the interplay between host genomic changes and gut microbial dynamics in the pathogenesis and treatment of hepatic cancers. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive review of current literature on genetic and epigenetic drivers of HCC and CCA, focusing on commonly mutated genes such as <i>TP53</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>TERT</i>, <i>IDH1/2</i>, and <i>FGFR2</i>. In parallel, we evaluated studies addressing the gut-liver axis, including the roles of dysbiosis, microbial metabolites, and immune modulation. Key clinical and preclinical findings were synthesized to explore how host-microbe interactions influence tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. <b>Results:</b> HCC and CCA exhibit distinct but overlapping genomic landscapes marked by recurrent mutations and epigenetic reprogramming. Alterations in the gut microbiota contribute to hepatic inflammation, genomic instability, and immune evasion, potentially enhancing oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, microbiota composition appears to affect responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Emerging therapeutic strategies such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and precision oncology based on mutational profiling demonstrate potential for personalized interventions. <b>Conclusions:</b> The integration of host genomics with microbial ecology provides a promising paradigm for advancing diagnostics and therapies in liver cancer. Targeting the gut-liver axis may complement genome-informed strategies to improve outcomes for patients with HCC and CCA.","Fu, Yuanji; Bonifacio-Mundaca, Jenny; Desterke, Christophe; Casafont, Íñigo; Mata-Garrido, Jorge","National Tumor Bank, Department of Pathology, National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, Surquillo 15038, Peru.; Cell and Tissue Biology Group, Anatomy and Cell Biology Department, University of Cantabria-IDIVAL, 39011 Santander, Spain.; Faculté de Médecine du Kremlin Bicêtre, University Paris-Sud, Université Paris-Saclay, 94270 Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France.; Institut Necker Enfants Malades, INSERM, CNRS, Université Paris Cité, F-75015 Paris, France.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver Neoplasms, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Carcinogenesis, Liver, Cholangiocarcinoma, Mutation, Epigenesis, Genetic, Animals",2025,07,30,2025,08,31,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869967,10.3390/genes16080920,,,,

The near-identical genomes across diverse individuals suggest an outbreak of a single circulating lineage at the time of this outbreak. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides the first genomic evidence of <i>Y. pestis</i> in the Eastern Mediterranean during the First Pandemic, linking archaeological findings with pathogen genomics near the origin point of the Plague of Justinian. <b>Summary Sentence</b>: Genomic evidence links <i>Y. pestis</i> to the First Pandemic in an ancient city.","Adapa, Swamy R; Hendrix, Karen; Upadhyay, Aditya; Dutta, Subhajeet; Vianello, Andrea; O'Corry-Crowe, Gregory; Monroy, Jorge; Ferrer, Tatiana; Remily-Wood, Elizabeth; Ferreira, Gloria C; Decker, Michael; Tykot, Robert H; Tripathy, Sucheta; Jiang, Rays H Y","USF Genomics, Global Health Infectious Disease Research Center (GHIDR), Global Health, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.; Near Eastern Archaeology Foundation, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.; Department of Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.; Department of Anthropology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.; Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, Florida Atlantic University, Fort Pierce, FL 33612, USA.; Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata 700032, India.; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India.; Department of History, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Yersinia pestis, Plague, Humans, Pandemics, Phylogeny, Genome, Bacterial, Jordan, History, Medieval, Whole Genome Sequencing, DNA, Bacterial, History, Ancient, DNA, Ancient",2025,07,31,2025,08,31,"Provost's CREATE fund_NONE_University of South Florida_; College of Public Health Research fund_NONE_University of South Florida , College of Public Health Research fund_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869973,10.3390/genes16080926,,,,
40869993,Genome-Wide Association Study and Meta-Analysis Uncovers Key Candidate Genes for Body Weight Traits in Chickens.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been extensively employed to elucidate the genetic architecture of body weight (BW) traits in chickens, which represent key economic indicators in broiler production. With the growing availability of genomic data from diverse commercial and resource chicken populations, a critical challenge lies in how to effectively integrate these datasets to enhance sample size and thereby improve the statistical power for detecting genetic variants associated with complex traits. In this study, we performed a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis on BW traits across three genetically distinct chicken populations, focusing on BW at 56, 70, and 84 days of age: P1 (N301 Yellow Plumage Dwarf Chicken Line; <i>n</i> = 426), P2 (F2 reciprocal cross: High Quality Line A × Huiyang Bearded chicken; <i>n</i> = 494), and P3 (F2 cross: Black-bone chicken × White Plymouth Rock; <i>n</i> = 223). Compared to single-population GWAS, our meta-analysis identified 77 novel independent variants significantly associated with BW traits, while gene-based association analysis implicated 59 relevant candidate genes. Functional annotation of BW56- and BW84-associated SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) 1_170526144G>T and 1_170642110A>G, integrated with tissue-specific regulatory annotations, revealed significant enrichment of enhancer and promoter elements for <i>KPNA3</i> and <i>CAB39L</i> in muscle, adipose, and intestinal tissues. Through this meta-analysis and integrative genomics approach, we identified novel candidate genes associated with body weight traits in chickens. These findings provide valuable mechanistic insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying body weight regulation in poultry and offer important references for selective breeding strategies aimed at improving production efficiency in the poultry industry.","Wen, Jintian; Zheng, Ming; Wang, Zhaochuan; Hu, Xiaoxiang; Li, Zhenhui","State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affair, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.; Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.; State Key Laboratory of Swine and Poultry Breeding Industry, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Animals, Chickens, Genome-Wide Association Study, Body Weight, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Phenotype",2025,08,11,2025,09,02,2023ZD04064_NONE_STI2030 Major Projects_; 2021YFD1300100_NONE_National Key R ＆ D Program of China_; 2022B1515120049_NONE_Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869993,10.3390/genes16080945,,,,
40870001,Mitochondrial Genome and RNA Editing Tissue Specificity of <i>Centella asiatica</i>.,"<i>Centella asiatica</i>, a medicinally important species that is rich in bioactive compounds, lacks a characterized mitochondrial genome, despite nuclear and chloroplast assemblies. We sequenced and annotated its mitochondrial genome to elucidate its genetic foundations and evolutionary mechanisms. Assembly using Illumina short-reads and Nanopore long-reads was used to characterize the mitochondrial genome. Analyses included structural characterization, codon usage bias, repetitive sequences, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), collinearity, and phylogeny. The resulting tissue-specific (root, stem, and leaf) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiles identified RNA editing sites. The complete mitochondrial genome (249,777 bp, 45.5% GC) comprises three circular contigs encoding 51 genes (33 protein-coding, 15 tRNA, and 3 rRNA). Comparative genomics revealed synteny with the Apiaceae family of plants and evidence of HGT. Phylogenetic analysis resolved taxonomic relationships within Apiales. We predicted that 547 RNA editing sites would be identified in its protein-coding genes. Tissue profiling identified 725 (root), 711 (stem), and 668 (leaf) editing sites, with >71% concordance to predictions. RNA editing-generated cryptic promoters/terminators occur in mitochondrial core function genes (e.g., ATP synthase, cytochrome c reductase/oxidase, ribosome large subunit, and cytochrome c biogenesis), exhibiting a lower frequency in the leaves compared to the roots and stems. We provide the first complete mitochondrial genome assembly for <i>C. asiatica</i>, delineating its complex structure, tissue-modulated RNA editing, and evolutionary trajectory. This high-quality genomic resource establishes a foundation for molecular evolutionary studies and enhances the genomic toolkit for this pharmacologically significant species.","Yang, Cuihong; Liang, Wenjing; Qin, Ya; Li, Yuqiong; Wei, Shugen; Huang, Qiulan; El-Sappah, Ahmed H; Tan, Guiyu; Wei, Ying; Gui, Lingjian; Wan, Lingyun","Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Engineering, Yibin University, Yibin 644000, China.; National Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Inheritance and Innovation, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, China.; Guangxi Key Laboratory for High-Quality Formation and Utilization of Dao-di Herbs, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, China.; National Engineering Research Center for the Development of Southwestern Endangered Medicinal Materials, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Nanning 530023, China.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"RNA Editing, Centella, Genome, Mitochondrial, Phylogeny, Organ Specificity, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Evolution, Molecular, RNA, Transfer, RNA, Long Noncoding",2025,08,12,2025,08,31,"(2023GXNSFAA026330); (Guike AD22035026); (GZKJ2305); (GZSY23-02); (ZJC2020003)_NONE_Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province (2023GXNSFAA026330), Gaungxi Bagui Brilliance Visiting Scholar Program (Lingyun Wan), Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Special Talents (Guike AD22035026), Innovative Team for Traditional Chinese Medici_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40870001,10.3390/genes16080953,,,,
40870010,Genomics in Lung Cancer: A Scoping Review of the Role of ctDNA in Non-Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the Prediction of Prognosis After Multimodality Therapeutic Approaches.,"<b>Background</b>: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), shed into bodily fluids by cancer cells through apoptosis, necrosis, or active secretion, is currently used in the field of genomic investigation in clinical settings, primarily for advanced stages of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its potential role in guiding the multi-omic approach to early-stage NSCLC is emerging as a promising area of investigation. Efforts are being made to integrate the genomics not only in surgery, but also in the definition of long-term prognosis after surgical or radiotherapy and for the prediction of recurrence. <b>Methods</b>: An extensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, covering publications from 2000 to 2024. Using the advanced search tool, titles and abstracts were filtered based on the following keywords: ctDNA, early stage, NSCLC. From this search, 20 studies that fulfilled all inclusion criteria were selected for analysis in this review. <b>Results</b>: This review highlights the growing body of evidence supporting the potential clinical use of ctDNA as a genomic biomarker in managing early-stage NSCLC. Baseline ctDNA levels offer valuable information about tumor molecular biology and histological characteristics. Beyond its prognostic value before treatment, liquid biopsy has proven useful for tracking minimal residual disease and forecasting recurrence following curative interventions such as surgery or radiotherapy. Future adjuvant treatment decisions may increasingly rely on predictive models that incorporate liquid biopsy findings alongside other clinical factors. <b>Conclusions</b>: The potential use of this analyte introduces new opportunities for the integration of genomic data in treatment, as well as relapse monitoring with more accurate and innovative than traditional methods, particularly in patients with early-stage NSCLC.","Sassorossi, Carolina; Evangelista, Jessica; Stefani, Alessio; Chiappetta, Marco; Martino, Antonella; Campanella, Annalisa; De Paolis, Elisa; Nachira, Dania; Del Re, Marzia; Guerrera, Francesco; Boldrini, Luca; Urbani, Andrea; Margaritora, Stefano; Minucci, Angelo; Bria, Emilio; Lococo, Filippo","Clinical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Operations (UOC), Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

However, its relevance in East Asian populations, particularly the Han Chinese, remains untested. This study aimed to replicate the association of rs10196189 with elite sprint-power athlete status in Han Chinese males and examine its potential influence on physical performance traits and tissue-specific gene regulation. <b>Methods</b>: A total of 188 healthy Han Chinese males (49 elite sprint-power athletes and 139 non-athletic controls) were genotyped using the TaqMan assay. Assessments included strength, sprint, jump, anaerobic power, DXA-derived body composition, and muscle ultrasound. Logistic regression and ROC analyses evaluated the predictive value of rs10196189. Linear regression models adjusted for age and BMI tested genotype-phenotype associations. Tissue expression and functional networks were analyzed using GTEx and HumanBase databases. <b>Results</b>: The G allele frequency was significantly higher in athletes (12.2%) than in controls (5.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.042). Dominant and additive models effectively predicted athlete status (OR = 2.53-2.58, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Although most traits showed no significant associations post-correction, medial gastrocnemius thickness showed a nominal association (β = 0.371, <i>p</i> = 0.011). Functional analyses revealed high GALNT13 expression in brain tissue and co-expression networks enriched in synaptic signaling and glycosylation pathways. <b>Conclusions</b>: This is the first study to validate the association of GALNT13 rs10196189 with elite athletic status in Han Chinese males. Findings provide novel population-specific evidence and propose tissue-specific glycosylation and neural mechanisms as pathways linking this variant to sprint-power phenotypes.","Chen, Lun; Wang, Mingrui; Liu, Longtianjiao; Jiang, Xiaoyu; Cao, Zihang; Azhati, Samuhaer; Chen, Hangyu; She, Kaixin; Zhu, Jinyao; Chen, Ming; Li, Jinda; Kong, Junhao; Zhang, Jiahao; Yan, Yuang; Dong, Yi; Mieryazi, Apudumalike; Liu, Songyu; Zhang, Yanyan; Ma, Yixuan; Shi, Lijun","Key Laboratory of Physical Fitness and Exercise, Ministry of Education, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China.; Laboratory of Sports Stress and Adaptation, General Administration of Sport of China, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China.; School of Education, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China.; Top-Tier Performance Physical Fitness Training Center, Beijing 100020, China.; Biomechanics Laboratory, Beijing Sports University, Beijing 100084, China.; Department of Exercise Physiology, Beijing Sport University, Beijing 100084, China.; Division of Sports Science and Physical Education, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.",Genes,Genes (Basel),"Adult, Humans, Male, Young Adult, Athletes, Athletic Performance, China, Gene Frequency, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, Phenotype, Pilot Projects, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, East Asian People",2025,08,20,2025,09,11,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40870030,10.3390/genes16080983,40870030,0,0,NONE

40806351,A 25K Wheat SNP Array Revealed the Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of Durum Wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> subsp. <i>durum</i>) Landraces and Cultivars.,"Durum wheat, the world's second most cultivated wheat species, is a staple crop, critical for global food security, including in Ethiopia where it serves as a center of diversity. However, climate change and genetic erosion threaten its genetic resources, necessitating genomic studies to support conservation and breeding efforts. This study characterized genome-wide diversity, population structure (STRUCTURE, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), neighbor-joining trees, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)), and selection signatures (F<sub>ST</sub>, Hardy-Weinberg deviations) in Ethiopian durum wheat by analyzing 376 genotypes (148 accessions) using an Illumina Infinium 25K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A set of 7842 high-quality SNPs enabled the assessments, comparing landraces with cultivars and breeding populations. Results revealed moderate genetic diversity (mean polymorphism information content (PIC) = 0.17; gene diversity = 0.20) and identified 26 loci under selection, associated with key traits like grain yield, stress tolerance, and disease resistance. AMOVA revealed 80.1% variation among accessions, with no significant differentiation by altitude, region, or spike density. Landraces formed distinct clusters, harboring unique alleles, while admixture suggested gene flow via informal seed exchange. The findings highlight Ethiopia's rich durum wheat diversity, emphasizing landraces as reservoirs of adaptive alleles for breeding. This study provides genomic insights to guide conservation and the development of climate-resilient cultivars, supporting sustainable wheat production globally.","Ararsa, Lalise; Mulugeta, Behailu; Bekele, Endashaw; Geleta, Negash; Abreha, Kibrom B; Geleta, Mulatu","Sinana Agricultural Research Center, OARI, Bale-Robe P.O.

40806388,Proteomic Insights into Bacterial Responses to Antibiotics: A Narrative Review.,"Antimicrobial resistance is an escalating global threat that undermines the efficacy of modern antibiotics and places a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems-costing Europe alone over EUR 11.7 billion each year due to rising medical expenses and productivity losses. While genomics and transcriptomics have significantly advanced our understanding of the genetic foundations of resistance, they often fail to capture the dynamic, real-time adaptations that enable bacterial survival. Proteomics, particularly mass spectrometry-based strategies, bridges this gap by uncovering the functional protein-level changes that drive resistance, persistence, and tolerance under antibiotic pressure. In this review, we examine how proteomic approaches provide new insights into resistance mechanisms across various antibiotic classes, with a particular focus on β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, highlighting clinically relevant pathogens, especially members of the ESKAPE group. Finally, we examine future directions, including the integration of proteomics with other omic technologies and the growing role of artificial intelligence in resistance prediction, paving the way for more predictive, personalized, and effective solutions to combat antimicrobial resistance.","Aita, Sara Elsa; Ristori, Maria Vittoria; Cristiano, Antonio; Marfoli, Tiziana; De Cesaris, Marina; La Vaccara, Vincenzo; Cammarata, Roberto; Caputo, Damiano; Spoto, Silvia; Angeletti, Silvia","Operative Research Unit of General Surgery, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico, 00128 Rome, Italy.; Diagnostic and Therapeutic Medicine Department, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico, 00128 Rome, Italy.; Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, PhD Program in Immunology, Molecular Medicine and Applied Biotechnologies, Tor Vergata University, 00133 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of General Surgery, Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, 00128 Rome, Italy.; Operative Research Unit of Laboratory, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico, 00128 Rome, Italy.; Research Unit of Clinical Laboratory Science, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, Via Alvaro del Portillo, 21, 00128 Rome, Italy.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Proteomics, Bacteria, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Humans, Bacterial Proteins",2025,07,27,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40806388,10.3390/ijms26157255,40806388,0,,
40806420,Characterization of Tellurite Toxicity to <i>Escherichia coli</i> Under Aerobic and Anaerobic Conditions.,"Tellurite (TeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is a highly soluble and toxic oxyanion that inhibits the growth of <i>Escherichia coli</i> at concentrations as low as ~1 µg/mL. This toxicity has been primarily attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its intracellular reduction by thiol-containing molecules and NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes. However, under anaerobic conditions, <i>E. coli</i> exhibits significantly increased tellurite tolerance-up to 100-fold in minimal media-suggesting the involvement of additional, ROS-independent mechanisms. In this study, we combined chemical-genomic screening, untargeted metabolomics, and targeted biochemical assays to investigate the effects of tellurite under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Our findings reveal that tellurite perturbs amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, leading to intracellular imbalances that impair protein synthesis. Additionally, tellurite induces notable changes in membrane lipid composition, particularly in phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives, which may influence biophysical properties of the membrane, such as fluidity or curvature. This membrane remodeling could contribute to the increased resistance observed under anaerobic conditions, although direct evidence of altered membrane fluidity remains to be established. Overall, these results demonstrate that tellurite toxicity extends beyond oxidative stress, impacting central metabolic pathways and membrane-associated functions regardless of oxygen availability.","Luraschi, Roberto; Muñoz-Villagrán, Claudia; Cornejo, Fabián A; Pugin, Benoit; Tobar, Fernanda Contreras; Sandoval, Juan Marcelo; Rivas-Pardo, Jaime Andrés; Vera, Carlos; Arenas, Felipe","Laboratory of Food Biotechnology, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zürich, 8092 Zürich, Switzerland.; Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Arturo Prat, Iquique 1110939, Chile.; Laboratorio de Ecología de Ambientes Extremos, Centro de Genómica, Ecología y Medio Ambiente (GEMA), Universidad Mayor, Santiago 8580745, Chile.; Laboratorio de Microbiología Molecular, Facultad de Química y Biología, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago 9170022, Chile.; Laboratorio de Genómica Microbiana, Escuela de Biotecnología, Centro de Genómica y Bioinformática, Facultad de Ciencias, Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Mayor, Santiago 8580745, Chile.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Tellurium, Escherichia coli, Anaerobiosis, Aerobiosis, Reactive Oxygen Species, Oxidative Stress, Metabolomics",2025,07,28,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40806420,10.3390/ijms26157287,40806420,0,,

40806492,Precision Neuro-Oncology in Glioblastoma: AI-Guided CRISPR Editing and Real-Time Multi-Omics for Genomic Brain Surgery.,"Precision neurosurgery is rapidly evolving as a medical specialty by merging genomic medicine, multi-omics technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, while at the same time, society is shifting away from the traditional, anatomic model of care to consider a more precise, molecular model of care. The general purpose of this review is to contemporaneously reflect on how these advances will impact neurosurgical care by providing us with more precise diagnostic and treatment pathways. We hope to provide a relevant review of the recent advances in genomics and multi-omics in the context of clinical practice and highlight their transformational opportunities in the existing models of care, where improved molecular insights can support improvements in clinical care. More specifically, we will highlight how genomic profiling, CRISPR-Cas9, and multi-omics platforms (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are increasing our understanding of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Achievements obtained with transformational technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing and intraoperative mass spectrometry are exemplary of the molecular diagnostic possibilities in real-time molecular diagnostics to enable a more directed approach in surgical options. We will also explore how identifying specific biomarkers (e.g., IDH mutations and MGMT promoter methylation) became a tipping point in the care of glioblastoma and allowed for the establishment of a new taxonomy of tumors that became applicable for surgeons, where a change in practice enjoined a different surgical resection approach and subsequently stratified the adjuvant therapies undertaken after surgery. Furthermore, we reflect on how the novel genomic characterization of mutations like DEPDC5 and SCN1A transformed the pre-surgery selection of surgical candidates for refractory epilepsy when conventional imaging did not define an epileptogenic zone, thus reducing resective surgery occurring in clinical practice. While we are atop the crest of an exciting wave of advances, we recognize that we also must be diligent about the challenges we must navigate to implement genomic medicine in neurosurgery-including ethical and technical challenges that could arise when genomic mutation-based therapies require the concurrent application of multi-omics data collection to be realized in practice for the benefit of patients, as well as the constraints from the blood-brain barrier. The primary challenges also relate to the possible gene privacy implications around genomic medicine and equitable access to technology-based alternative practice disrupting interventions. We hope the contribution from this review will not just be situational consolidation and integration of knowledge but also a stimulus for new lines of research and clinical practice.

40806501,Genetic Divergence and Functional Significance of Bioactive Compounds in Rice and Barley: Implications for Biofortification and Human Health.,"The functional components in cereals (rice and barley), such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), resistant starch (RS), and alkaloids, play crucial roles in human health, offering benefits such as improved cardiovascular function, enhanced gut microbiota, and potential anticancer properties. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) are key dietary staples with distinct genetic architectures influencing the biosynthesis and accumulation of these bioactive compounds. In this study, we explore the interaction and divergence of gene loci associated with GABA, RS, and alkaloid pathways in rice and barley, leveraging comparative genomics to identify conserved and species-specific regulatory mechanisms. We highlight key quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate genes, such as GAD (glutamate decarboxylase) for GABA synthesis, <i>SSIIa</i> and <i>GBSS</i> for RS formation, and alkaloid biosynthesis genes including <i>CYP80G2</i>. Additionally, we discuss the health implications of these functional components, including their roles in reducing hypertension, managing diabetes, and exhibiting neuroprotective effects. Understanding the genetic differences between rice and barley in accumulating these compounds can guide biofortification strategies to enhance nutritional quality in cereal crops, ultimately benefiting human health and dietary outcomes.","ElShamey, Essam; Yang, Jiazhen; Yang, Xiaomeng; Hasan, Md Mahmudul; Yang, Tao; Zeng, Yawen","Biotechnology and Germplasm Resources Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650205, China.; Rice Research Department, Field Crops Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, Cairo 12619, Egypt.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Hordeum, Oryza, Humans, Quantitative Trait Loci, Biofortification, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, Alkaloids, Genetic Variation, Starch",2025,07,30,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40806501,10.3390/ijms26157374,40806501,0,,
40806548,Case Report of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus with a Novel Mutation in the <i>AQP2</i> Gene.,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by renal resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP), resulting in the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine. Approximately 90% of NDI cases follow an X-linked inheritance pattern and are associated with pathogenic variants in the <i>AVPR2</i> gene, which encodes the vasopressin receptor type 2. The remaining 10% are attributed to mutations in the <i>AQP2</i> gene, which encodes aquaporin-2, and may follow either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance patterns. We present the case of a male infant, younger than nine months of age, who was clinically diagnosed with NDI at six months. The patient presented recurrent episodes of polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, hypernatremia, and persistently low urine osmolality. Despite adjustments in pharmacologic treatment and strict monitoring of urinary output, the clinical response remained suboptimal. Given the lack of improvement and the radiological finding of an absent posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis), the possibility of coexistent central diabetes insipidus (CDI) was raised, prompting a therapeutic trial with desmopressin. Nevertheless, in the absence of clinical improvement, desmopressin was discontinued. The patient's management was continued with hydrochlorothiazide, ibuprofen, and a high-calorie diet restricted in sodium and protein, resulting in progressive clinical stabilization. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in the <i>AQP2</i> gene (c.398T > A; p.Val133Glu), classified as likely pathogenic according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria: PM2 (absent from population databases), PP2 (missense variant in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation), and PP3 (multiple lines of computational evidence supporting a deleterious effect)]. NDI is typically diagnosed during early infancy due to the early onset of symptoms and the potential for severe complications if left untreated. In this case, although initial clinical suspicion included concomitant CDI, the timely initiation of supportive management and the subsequent incorporation of molecular diagnostics facilitated a definitive diagnosis. The identification of a previously unreported homozygous variant in <i>AQP2</i> contributed to diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic decision-making. The diagnosis and comprehensive management of NDI within the context of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, integrating clinical evaluation with advanced molecular diagnostics. The novel <i>AQP2</i> c.398T > A (p.Val133Glu) variant described herein was associated with early and severe clinical manifestations, underscoring the importance of genetic testing in atypical or treatment-refractory presentations of diabetes insipidus.","Padilla-Guzmán, Alejandro; Ochoa-Jiménez, Vanessa Amparo; Forero-Delgadillo, Jessica María; Apraez-Murillo, Karen; Pachajoa, Harry; Restrepo, Jaime M","Health Sciences Faculty, Universidad Icesi, Cali 760031, Colombia.; Centro de Investigaciones Clínicas, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali 760032, Colombia.; Department of Maternal and Child Health, Pediatric Nephrology Service, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali 760032, Colombia.; Medical Genetics Service, Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali 760032, Colombia.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Humans, Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic, Aquaporin 2, Male, Infant, Mutation, Receptors, Vasopressin, Deamino Arginine Vasopressin",2025,08,01,2025,08,26,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40806548,10.3390/ijms26157415,40806548,0,,
40806607,Omics-Mediated Treatment for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Moving Towards Precision Oncology.,"Prostate cancer accounts for approximately 1.5 million new diagnoses and 400,000 deaths every year worldwide, and demographic projections indicate a near-doubling of both figures by 2040. Despite existing treatments, 10-20% of patients eventually progress to metastatic castration-resistant disease (mCRPC). The median overall survival (OS) after progression to mCPRC drops to 24 months, and efficacy drops severely after each additional line of treatment. Omics platforms have reached advanced levels and enable the acquisition of high-resolution large datasets that can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa pathology. Genomics, especially DDR (DNA damage response) gene alterations, detected via tissue and/or circulating tumor DNA, efficiently guides therapy in advanced prostate cancer. Given recent developments, we have performed a comprehensive literature search to cover recent research and clinical trial reports (over the last five years) that integrate omics along three converging trajectories in therapeutic development: (i) predicting response to approved agents with demonstrated survival benefits, (ii) stratifying patients to receive therapies in clinical trials, (iii) guiding drug development as part of drug repurposing frameworks. Collectively, this review is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource of recent advancements in omics-guided therapies for advanced prostate cancer, a clinical setting with existing clinical needs and poor outcomes.","Fatima, Yasra; Jobre, Kirubel Nigusu; Gomez-Gomez, Enrique; Małkiewicz, Bartosz; Vlahou, Antonia; Mokou, Marika; Mischak, Harald; Frantzi, Maria; Jankowski, Vera","Systems Biology Center, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens, 115 27 Athens, Greece.; Department of Minimally Invasive and Robotic Urology, Centre of Excellence in Urology, Wroclaw Medical University, 213 Borowska Street, 50-556 Wroclaw, Poland.; Urology Department, Reina Sofía University Hospital, Maimonides Institute of Biomedical Research of Cordoba (IMIBIC), University of Cordoba (UCO), 14004 Cordoba, Spain.; Department of Biomarker Research, Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, 30659 Hannover, Germany.; Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research (IMCAR), RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Humans, Male, Precision Medicine, Genomics, Prostatic Neoplasms, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, Biomarkers, Tumor",2025,08,02,2025,08,26,"TRR 219; Project-ID 322900939_NONE_Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft´ (DFG, German Research Foundation)_; ProSTRAT-AI (01DS23014)_NONE_BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)_; ERA-PerMed (ERA-PERMED2022-202-KidneySign)_NONE_Cost-Action CA_; 445703531_NONE_CRU 5011_; 101169245: HORIZON - MSCA-2023-DN-01-01_NONE_Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Doctoral Networks Industrial Doctorates Programme project PROMOTE_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40806607,10.3390/ijms26157475,40806607,0,,

40869008,"Candidate Genes, Markers, Signatures of Selection, and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and Their Association with Economic Traits in Livestock: Genomic Insights and Selection.","This review synthesizes advances in livestock genomics by examining the interplay between candidate genes, molecular markers (MMs), signatures of selection (SSs), and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in shaping economically vital traits across livestock species. By integrating advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and precision breeding, the study elucidates genetic mechanisms underlying productivity, reproduction, meat quality, milk yield, fibre characteristics, disease resistance, and climate resilience traits pivotal to meeting the projected 70% surge in global animal product demand by 2050. A critical synthesis of 1455 peer-reviewed studies reveals that targeted genetic markers (e.g., SNPs, <i>Indels</i>) and QTL regions (e.g., <i>IGF2</i> for muscle development, <i>DGAT1</i> for milk composition) enable precise selection for superior phenotypes. SSs, identified through genome-wide scans and haplotype-based analyses, provide insights into domestication history, adaptive evolution, and breed-specific traits, such as heat tolerance in tropical cattle or parasite resistance in sheep. Functional candidate genes, including leptin (<i>LEP</i>) for feed efficiency and myostatin (<i>MSTN</i>) for double-muscling, are highlighted as drivers of genetic gain in breeding programs. The review underscores the transformative role of high-throughput sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and CRISPR-based editing in accelerating trait discovery and validation. However, challenges persist, such as gene interactions, genotype-environment interactions, and ethical concerns over genetic diversity loss. By advocating for a multidisciplinary framework that merges genomic data with phenomics, metabolomics, and advanced biostatistics, this work serves as a guide for researchers, breeders, and policymakers. For example, incorporating <i>DGAT1</i> markers into dairy cattle programs could elevate milk fat content by 15-20%, directly improving farm profitability. The current analysis underscores the need to harmonize high-yield breeding with ethical practices, such as conserving heat-tolerant cattle breeds, like Sahiwal.","Hassanine, Nada N A M; Saleh, Ahmed A; Essa, Mohamed Osman Abdalrahem; Adam, Saber Y; Mohai Ud Din, Raza; Rehman, Shahab Ur; Ali, Rahmat; Husien, Hosameldeen Mohamed; Wang, Mengzhi","College of Animal Science and Technology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Animals, Quantitative Trait Loci, Livestock, Genomics, Selection, Genetic, Genetic Markers, Genome-Wide Association Study, Breeding, Phenotype, Cattle",2025,08,08,2025,08,31,"(2024YFD1300204, 2023YFD1301705), (G2023014066L)_NONE_This work was supported by the National 14th Five-Year Plan Key Research and Development Program (2024YFD1300204, 2023YFD1301705), high-end foreign experts from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (G2023014066L), and the Priority Academic Prog_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869008,10.3390/ijms26167688,40869008,0,0,NONE
40869199,Multi-Omics Reveals Molecular and Genetic Mechanisms Underlying Egg Albumen Quality Decline in Aging Laying Hens.,"As the laying cycle is prolonged, the egg albumen quality exhibits a declining trend. A Haugh unit (HU) is a standard measure of the albumen quality, which reflects viscosity and freshness. During the late laying period, the HU not only decreased significantly, but also exhibited greater variability among individuals. The magnum, as the primary site of albumen synthesis, plays a central role in this process; however, the mechanisms by which it regulates the albumen quality remain unclear. To address this, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 254 individuals, along with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the magnum tissue. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across five laying stages (66, 72, 80, 90, and 100 weeks of age) identified 77 HU-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping linked these variants to the expression of 12 genes in magnum tissue. In addition, transcriptomic analysis using linear regression and random forest models identified 259 genes that significantly correlated with the HU. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed two key cell types, plasma cells and a subset of epithelial cells, marked by <i>ADAMTSL1</i> and <i>OVAL</i>, which are functionally relevant to the HU. Through integrated Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) and Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analyses, we identified four robust regulators of the albumen quality: <i>CISD1</i>, <i>NQO2</i>, <i>SLC22A23</i>, and <i>CMTM6</i>. These genes are functionally involved in mitochondrial function, antioxidant defense, and membrane transport. Overall, our findings uncovered the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related decline in the albumen quality and identified potential targets for improving the egg quality in aging flocks.","Gao, Mingyue; Zhang, Junnan; Yang, Ning; Sun, Congjiao","National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding, College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.; Frontier Science Center of Molecular Design Breeding, State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Animals, Genome-Wide Association Study, Female, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Chickens, Aging, Albumins, Eggs, Transcriptome, Gene Expression Profiling, Multiomics",2025,08,15,2025,08,31,No. 32472894_NONE_the National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 00109015_NONE_the 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University_; 2021YFD1300600_NONE_National Key Research and Development Program of China_; CARS-40_NONE_China Agriculture Research Systems_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869199,10.3390/ijms26167876,40869199,0,0,NONE

Understanding the molecular underpinnings of grapevine resilience is crucial for developing adaptive strategies. Our aim is to explore the application of multi-omics approaches (integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics) to investigate grapevine stress responses. Advances in these omics technologies have been pivotal in identifying key stress-response genes, metabolic pathways, and regulatory networks, particularly those contributing to grapevine tolerance to water deficiency, (such as drought and decreased precipitation), extreme temperatures, UV radiation, and salinity. Furthermore, the rich genetic reservoir within grapevines serves as a vital resource for enhancing stress tolerance. While adaptive strategies such as rootstock selection and precision irrigation are important, future research must prioritize integrated multi-omics studies, including those on regional climate adaptation and long-term breeding programs. Such efforts are essential to exploit genetic diversity and ensure the sustainability of viticulture in the evolving climate. In summary, this review demonstrates how utilizing the inherent genetic variability of grapevines and employing multi-omics approaches are critical for understanding and enhancing their resilience to the challenges posed by climate change.","Konecny, Tomas; Asatryan, Armine; Binder, Hans","Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics, Leipzig University, 04107 Leipzig, Germany.; Armenian Bioinformatics Institute, Yerevan 0014, Armenia.; Institute of Molecular Biology of National Academy of Sciences, Yerevan 0014, Armenia.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Vitis, Climate Change, Stress, Physiological, Metabolomics, Genomics, Proteomics, Genetic Variation, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Transcriptome",2025,08,15,2025,08,31,25FAST-1F005_NONE_Higher Education and Science Committee_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869197,10.3390/ijms26167877,40869197,0,0,NONE

40869351,The Role of GCH1 Deficiency and Tetrahydrobiopterin in Mental Health.,"Treatment-resistant mental health concerns significantly contribute to society in terms of financial costs and individually by creating emotional and functional costs. An important yet little-recognized cause of treatment-resistant mental health conditions is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is an essential cofactor for producing serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide-molecules critical to mood and focus. The enzyme GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), produced by a gene of the same name, catalyzes the first step in synthesizing BH4. Variants in this gene have been associated with low BH4 levels, as well as depression and ADHD. The case reports presented in this article illustrate that a partial BH4 deficiency, as conveyed by the <i>GCH1</i> rs841 variant, may contribute to wider issues in mental and neurological health including depression and ADHD but also severe treatment-resistant anxiety, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, insomnia, complex behavioral issues, and autism. The effects of GCH1-mediated BH4 deficiency may be able to be rescued with a low-dose BH4 replacement, as illustrated by these cases, where substantial observational improvements in mental health concerns were reported in all five cases. This paper also demonstrates how a genomics clinical decision support tool can non-invasively flag ""low producers"" by identifying individuals with the AA genotype for <i>GCH1</i> rs841, as well as other modifiable genomic contributing factors to mental health concerns. These cases broaden the understanding of BH4's psychiatric relevance and also serve to further the medical literature by documenting positive responses to low-dose BH4 (ranging from 0.09 to 0.3 mg/kg/day) and other genotype-guided interventions across diverse mental and neurological health presentations, highlighting the potential benefits and importance of a genomically targeted, precision approach to psychiatry.","Williams, Grant E; Hausman-Cohen, Sharon; Sotos, Maryelaine; Gutierrez, Emily; Bilich, Carol; Mueller, Francis W; Jagshi, Shaun","IntellxxDNATM, Austin, TX 78731, USA.; Neuronutrition Associates, Austin, TX 78759, USA.; Huebner Family Medicine, San Antonio, TX 78240, USA.; Resilient Health, Austin, TX 78731, USA.",International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,"Humans, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity, Biopterins, GTP Cyclohydrolase, Mental Health, Phenylketonurias",2025,08,20,2025,09,12,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869351,10.3390/ijms26168030,40869351,0,0,NONE

40869406,Cervicovaginal Microbiome and HPV: A Standardized Approach to 16S/ITS NGS and Microbial Community Profiling for Viral Association.,"16S rRNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) has significantly advanced cervicovaginal microbiome profiling, offering insights into the relationship between vaginal dysbiosis and HPV-associated carcinogenesis. However, reliance on a limited set of 16S hypervariable regions introduces inherent biases that impact results. This study developed standardized workflows for 16S/ITS NGS, with a focus on identifying methodological biases that influence microbial abundance and taxonomic specificity. Commercial NGS tools were employed, including the 16S/ITS QIAseq V1-V9 screening panel, ATCC vaginal microbial standard, and CLC Genomics Workbench integrated with a customized database (VAGIBIOTA) for analysis. The microbial communities of 66 cervical cytology samples were characterized. Among the regions tested, V3V4 exhibited the least quantitative bias, while V1V2 offered the highest specificity.

By analyzing gene expression profiles and miRNA interactions, the goal is to identify key regulatory miRNAs and signaling pathways that differentiate these tumor types and could serve as important regulators for therapy development. Raw data for seminomas and teratomas were extracted from the GEO database, and gene hubs were identified using STRING and Gephi. Signaling pathways and functional annotations were analyzed using miRPathDB, while miRNA-gene interactions were explored via miRWalk. Hub miRNAs were filtered and confirmed using miRDB. This study highlights significant changes in gene expression diversity between tumor and normal gonadal tissues, providing insights into the molecular dynamics of seminomas and teratomas. Distinctions between seminomas and teratomas were identified, shifting the focus toward miRNAs to discover more precise and novel therapeutic approaches. The hub genes of seminomas and teratomas were identified separately. MiRNAs targeting these hub genes were also determined and confirmed.

40870551,Black Soldier Fly: A Keystone Species for the Future of Sustainable Waste Management and Nutritional Resource Development: A Review.,"The global escalation of organic waste generation, coupled with rising protein demand and environmental pressure, necessitates innovative, circular approaches to resource management. <i>Hermetia illucens</i> (Black Soldier Fly, BSF) has emerged as a leading candidate for integrated waste-to-resource systems. This review examines BSF biological and genomic adaptations underpinning waste conversion efficiency, comparative performance of BSF bioconversion versus traditional treatments, nutritional and functional attributes, techno-economic, regulatory, and safety barriers to industrial scale-up. Peer-reviewed studies were screened for methodological rigor, and data on life cycle traits, conversion metrics, and product compositions were synthesized. BSF larvae achieve high waste reductions, feed-conversion efficiencies and redirect substrate carbon into biomass, yielding net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as low as 12-17 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq ton<sup>-1</sup>, an order of magnitude below composting or vermicomposting. Larval biomass offers protein, lipids (notably lauric acid), micronutrients, chitin, and antimicrobial peptides, with frass serving as a nutrient-rich fertilizer. Pathogen and antibiotic resistance gene loads decrease during bioconversion. Key constraints include substrate heterogeneity, heavy metal accumulation, fragmented regulatory landscapes, and high energy and capital demands. BSF systems demonstrate superior environmental and nutritional performance compared to conventional waste treatments. Harmonized safety standards, feedstock pretreatment, automation, and green extraction methods are critical to overcoming scale-up barriers. Interdisciplinary innovation and policy alignment will enable BSF platforms to realize their full potential within circular bio-economies.","Tariq, Muhammad Raheel; Liu, Shaojuan; Wang, Fei; Wang, Hui; Mo, Qianyuan; Zhuang, Zhikai; Zheng, Chaozhong; Liang, Yanwen; Liu, Youming; Ur Rehman, Kashif; Helvaci, Murat; Qin, Jianguang; Li, Chengpeng","German Institute of Food Technologies (DIL e.V.), Prof.-v.-Klitzing-Str. 7, 49610 Quakenbrück, Germany.; School of Chemistry and Environment Science, Guangdong Ocean University, Zhanjiang 524088, China.; College of Science & Engineering, Flinders University, Adelaide 5001, Australia.; Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies, European University of Lefke, Gemikonagi, Northern Cyprus, Mersin 99780, Türkiye.; Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.; Agricultural Products Processing Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Zhanjiang 524001, China.; College of Food Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 524088, China.",Insects,Insects,,2025,07,22,2025,09,15,2024R1005_NONE_Guangdong Provincial Talent Development Strategy - Zhanjiang Science and Technology Programme Funds_; 1630012025214_NONE_the Central Public interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Funds_; ZDYF2024XDNY194_NONE_Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund_; 325QN438_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; G20250218013E_NONE_Hainan Province Foreign Experts Fund_; 323QN290_NONE_Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; 010202122301_NONE_Teaching Quality and Teaching Reform Project of Guangdong Ocean University_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40870551,10.3390/insects16080750,40870551,0,0,NONE

To facilitate the conservation of germplasm resources and maintain genetic diversity, it is imperative to elucidate the population structure and lineage differentiation of <i>A. cerana</i> within this ecologically distinct region. In this study, we collected <i>A. cerana</i> specimens from 12 geographically disparate locations across various altitudinal gradients within the Jilong Valley, and also integrated publicly available sequencing data of <i>A. cerana</i> from various regions across mainland Asia. In total, our analysis encompassed sequencing data from 296 individuals. Population structure analyses based on SNP data revealed that <i>A. cerana</i> in Jilong represents a genetically distinct population that differs markedly from other regional <i>A. cerana</i> populations in terms of genetic lineage, although its subspecies identity remains to be confirmed. Through screening based on F<sub>ST</sub> values, we identified SNP loci that contribute significantly to distinguishing between Jilong and non-Jilong <i>A. cerana</i>. Using these loci, the convolutional neural network model TraceNet was trained, which demonstrated specific recognition capabilities for Jilong versus non-Jilong <i>A. cerana</i>. This further confirmed the universality and efficiency of TraceNet in identifying honey bee lineages.

40869459,Host-Microbiome Interactions in Chronic Itch.,"Chronic itch is a debilitating condition characterized by persistent pruritus lasting more than six weeks, significantly impairing quality of life. While the role of the immune system and neural circuits in itch is increasingly understood, the contribution of the skin microbiome, especially in non-atopic itch disorders, remains underexplored. This review synthesizes emerging evidence on how microbial dysbiosis contributes to chronic pruritus through multiple molecular pathways: disruption of skin barrier integrity, modulation of neuroimmune signaling axes, and direct activation of pruriceptors. We highlight recent studies identifying microbiome shifts in prurigo nodularis (PN) and lichen simplex chronicus (LSC), independent of atopic dermatitis (AD). We also evaluate advances in biologics and small-molecule therapeutics, exploring how targeted immune modulation may restore microbial balance and alleviate neuroinflammation. A systems biology approach integrating microbial genomics, neurobiology, and host immunity is critical to unraveling the complex interplay between host and microbes in chronic itch, particularly in understudied non-atopic conditions that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.","Gonzalez, Tammy; Bilik, Sophie M; Burke, Olivia M; Pastar, Irena; Yosipovitch, Gil","Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.",Journal of clinical medicine,J Clin Med,,2025,08,09,2025,09,14,Patient Directed Investigation Grant_NONE_Dermatology Foundation_; 1P50MD017347-03_NH_NIH HHS_United States; P50 MD017347_MD_NIMHD NIH HHS_United States; Danby Research Grant_NONE_Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation_; R01DK1342161_GF_NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40869459,10.3390/jcm14165633,40869459,0,0,NONE
40843895,Evolution of the Jawed Vertebrate (Gnathostomata) Stomach Through Gene Repertoire Loss: Findings from Agastric Species.,"The stomach has been a highly conserved organ throughout vertebrate evolution; however, there are now over 20 lineages composed of monotremes, lungfish and teleost fish displaying a secondary loss of stomach function and morphology. This ""agastric phenotype"" has evolved convergently and is typified by a loss of gastric glands and gastric acid secretion and a near-to-complete loss of storage capacity of the stomach. All agastric species have lost the genes for gastric enzymes (<i>Pga</i> and <i>Pgc</i>) and proton pump subunits (<i>Atp4a</i> and <i>Atp4b</i>), and gastrin (<i>Gast</i>) has been lost in monotremes. As a key gastric hormone, the conservation of gastrin has not yet been investigated in the lungfish or agastric teleosts, and it is unclear how the loss of gastrin affects the evolution and selection of the native receptor (<i>Cckbr</i>), gastrin-releasing peptide (<i>Grp</i>) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (<i>Grpr</i>) in vertebrates. Furthermore, there are still many genes implicated in gastric development and function which have yet to be associated with the agastric phenotype. We analysed the evolution, selection and conservation of the gastrin pathway and a novel gastric gene repertoire (<i>Gkn1</i>, <i>Gkn2</i>, <i>Tff1</i>, <i>Tff2</i>, <i>Vsig1</i> and <i>Anxa10</i>) to determine the correlation with the agastric phenotype. We found that the loss of gastrin or its associated genes does not correlate with the agastric phenotype, and their conservation is due to multiple pleiotropic roles throughout vertebrate evolution. We found a loss of the gastric gene repertoire in the agastric phenotype, except in the echidna, which retained several genes (<i>Gkn1</i>, <i>Tff2</i> and <i>Vsig1</i>). Our findings suggest that the gastrin physiological pathway evolved differently in pleiotropic roles throughout vertebrate evolution and support the convergent evolution of the agastric phenotype through shared independent gene-loss events.","Dann, Jackson; Grützner, Frank","Robinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; School of Biological Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Journal of developmental biology,J Dev Biol,,2025,08,05,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40843895,10.3390/jdb13030027,40843895,0,0,NONE
40863502,Beyond White-Nose Syndrome: Mitochondrial and Functional Genomics of <i>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</i>.,"White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) has devastated insectivorous bat populations, particularly in North America, leading to severe ecological and economic consequences.

Here, we present a multi-scale genomic analysis integrating pangenome reconstruction, phylogenetic inference, Bayesian divergence dating, comparative mitochondrial genomics, and refined functional annotation. Our divergence dating analysis reveals that <i>P. destructans</i> separated from its Antarctic relatives approximately 141 million years ago, before adapting to bat hibernacula in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, our refined functional annotation significantly expands the known functional landscape of <i>P. destructans</i>, revealing an extensive repertoire of previously uncharacterized proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthesis-key processes that likely contribute to its pathogenic success.

40863552,Genomic Insights into the Molecular Basis of Broad Host Adaptability of the Entomopathogenic Fungus <i>Conidiobolus coronatus</i> (Entomophthoromycotina).,"<i>Conidiobolus coronatus</i> (Entomophthorales), a fungal pathogen with a broad insect host range, is a promising candidate for biocontrol applications. We sequenced a <i>C. coronatus</i> strain isolated from a <i>Rhopalomyia</i> sp. cadaver using PacBio long-read sequencing to elucidate the molecular basis of its wide host adaptability. The newly assembled 44.21 Mb genome exhibits high completeness (BUSCO score: 93.45%) and encodes 11,128 protein-coding genes, with 23.1% predicted to mediate pathogen-host interactions. Comparative genomics with the aphid-obligate pathogen <i>C. obscurus</i> revealed significant expansions in gene families associated with host adaptation mechanisms, including host recognition, transcriptional regulation, degradation of host components, detoxification, and immune evasion. Functional annotation highlighted enrichment in cellular component organization and energy metabolism. Pfam annotation identified one hundred twenty-five seven-transmembrane receptors (putative GPCRs), sixty-seven fungus-specific transcription factors, three hundred sixty-one peptidases (one hundred ninety-eight serine proteases and one hundred three metalloproteases), one hundred twenty-seven cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), thirty-five cysteine-rich secretory proteins, and fifty-five tyrosinases. Additionally, four hundred thirty carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) across six major modules were characterized. Untargeted metabolomics detected 22 highly expressed terpenoids, consistent with terpenoid biosynthesis gene clusters in the genome. Collectively, these expansions underpin the broad host range of <i>C. coronatus</i> by enabling cross-host signal decoding and gene expression reprogramming, breaching diverse host physicochemical barriers, and expanding its chemical ecological niche. This study provides genomic insights into broad host adaptability in entomopathogenic fungi, facilitating further understanding of pathogen-host interactions.","Bai, Fan; Yang, Tian; Zhang, Lvhao; Yang, Jiaqi; Chen, Xinyu; Zhou, Xiang","National Key Laboratory for Development and Utilization of Forest Food Resources, School of Forestry and Biotechnology, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou 311300, China.","Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",J Fungi (Basel),,2025,08,19,2025,09,14,32271883_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40863552,10.3390/jof11080600,40863552,0,0,NONE
40863452,"Lost in .*VCF Translation. From Data Fragmentation to Precision Genomics: Technical, Ethical, and Interpretive Challenges in the Post-Sequencing Era.","<b>Background:</b> The genomic era has transformed not only the tools of medicine but the very logic by which we understand health and disease. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), Clinical Exome Sequencing (CES), and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) have catalyzed a shift from Mendelian simplicity to polygenic complexity, from genetic determinism to probabilistic interpretation. This epistemological evolution calls into question long-standing notions of causality, certainty, and identity in clinical genomics. Yet, as the promise of precision medicine grows, so too do the tensions it generates: fragmented data, interpretative opacity, and the ethical puzzles of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUSs) and unsolicited secondary findings. <b>Results:</b> Despite technological refinement, the diagnostic yield of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) remains inconsistent, hindered by the inherent intricacy of gene-environment interactions and constrained by rigid classificatory systems like OMIM and HPO. VUSs (neither definitively benign nor pathogenic) occupy a liminal space that resists closure, burdening both patients and clinicians with uncertainty. Meanwhile, secondary findings, though potentially life-altering, challenge the boundaries of consent, privacy, and responsibility. In both adult and pediatric contexts, genomic knowledge reshapes notions of autonomy, risk, and even personhood. <b>Conclusions:</b> Genomic medicine has to develop into a flexible, morally sensitive paradigm that neither celebrates certainty nor ignores ambiguity. Open infrastructures, dynamic variant reclassification, and a renewed focus on interdisciplinary and humanistic approaches are essential. Only by embracing the uncertainty intrinsic to our biology can precision medicine fulfill its promise, not as a deterministic science, but as a nuanced dialogue between genes, environments, and lived experience.","Chetta, Massimiliano; Tarsitano, Marina; Bukvic, Nenad; Fontana, Laura; Miozzo, Monica Rosa","U.O.C Genetica Medica, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Consorziale Policlinico di Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy.; A.O.R.N.

This advancement has led to the development of living PDO biobanks, collections of organoids derived from a wide range of tumor types and patient populations, which serve as essential platforms for drug screening, biomarker discovery, and functional genomics. The classification and global distribution of these biobanks reflect a growing international effort to standardize protocols and broaden accessibility, supporting both basic and translational research. While their relevance to personalized medicine is increasingly recognized, the establishment and maintenance of PDO biobanks remain technically demanding, particularly in terms of optimizing long-term culture conditions, preserving sample viability, and mimicking the tumor microenvironment.

40805356,Machine Learning-Driven Design and Optimization of Multi-Metal Nitride Hard Coatings via Multi-Arc Ion Plating Using Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Regression.,"The goal of this study is to develop an efficient machine learning framework for designing high-hardness multi-metal nitride coatings, overcoming the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. The development of multicomponent metal nitride hard coatings via multi-arc ion plating remains a significant challenge due to the vast compositional search space. Although theoretical studies in macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic domains exist, these often focus on idealized models and lack effective coupling across scales, leading to time-consuming and labor-intensive traditional methods. With advancements in materials genomics and data mining, machine learning has become a powerful tool in material discovery. In this work, we construct a compositional search space for multicomponent nitrides based on electronic configuration, valence electron count, electronegativity, and oxidation states of metal elements in unary nitrides. The search space is further constrained by FCC crystal structure and hardness theory. By incorporating a feature library with micro-, meso-, and macro-structural characteristics and using clustering analysis with theoretical intermediate variables, the model enriches dataset information and enhances predictive accuracy by reducing experimental errors. This model is successfully applied to design multicomponent metal nitride coatings using a literature-derived database of 233 entries. Experimental validation confirms the model's predictions, and clustering is used to minimize experimental and data errors, yielding a strong agreement between predicted optimal molar ratios of metal elements and nitrogen and measured hardness performance. Of the 100 Vickers hardness (HV) predictions made by the model using input features like molar ratios of metal elements (e.g., Ti, Al, Cr, Zr) and atomic size mismatch, 82 exceeded the dataset's maximum hardness, with the best sample achieving a prediction accuracy of 91.6% validated against experimental measurements. This approach offers a robust strategy for designing high-performance coatings with optimized hardness.","Gu, Yu; Wang, Jiayue; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Yu; Dai, Bushi; Li, Yu; Liu, Guangchao; Bao, Li; Lu, Rihuan","Laboratory of Research and Application of Multiple Hard Films, Shenyang University, Shenyang 110044, China.; School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Qiqihar University, Qiqihar 161000, China.; College of Intelligence and Informatics, Shenyang University, Shenyang 110044, China.; College of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang University, Shenyang 110044, China.; National Engineering Research Center for Equipment and Technology of Cold Rolled Strip, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao 066004, China.; Informatization Office, Shenyang University, Shenyang 110044, China.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",Materials (Basel),,2025,07,24,2025,08,17,No. E2021203179_NONE_Hebei Natural Science Foundation of China_; No. 52005432_NONE_the National Natural Science Foundation of China_; No. 52405382_NONE_the National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40805356,10.3390/ma18153478,40805356,0,,

40871222,An Updated Perspective on the Aromatic Metabolic Pathways of Plant-Derived Homocyclic Aromatic Compounds in <i>Aspergillus niger</i>.,"Aromatic compounds are vital in both natural and synthetic chemistry, and they are traditionally sourced from non-renewable petrochemicals. However, plant biomass, particularly lignin, offers a renewable alternative source of aromatic compounds. Lignin, a complex polymer found in plant cell walls, is the largest renewable source of aromatic compounds, though its degradation remains challenging. Lignin can be chemically degraded through oxidation, acid hydrolysis or solvolysis. As an alternative, microorganisms, including fungi, could offer a sustainable alternative for breaking down lignin. The aromatic compounds released from lignin, by either microbial, chemical or enzymatic degradation, can be used by microorganisms to produce valuable compounds. Fungi possess unique enzymes capable of converting aromatic compounds derived from lignin or other sources into chemical building blocks that can be used in several industries. However, their aromatic metabolic pathways are poorly studied compared to bacterial systems. In the past, only a handful of genes and enzymes involved in the aromatic metabolic pathways had been identified. Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolic engineering are helping to reveal these metabolic pathways and identify the involved genes. This review highlights recent progress in understanding fungal aromatic metabolism, focusing on how <i>Aspergillus niger</i> converts plant-derived aromatic compounds into potentially useful products and the versatility of aromatic metabolism within the <i>Aspergillus</i> genus. Addressing the current knowledge gaps in terms of fungal pathways could unlock their potential for use in sustainable technologies, promoting eco-friendly production of chemical building blocks from renewable resources or bioremediation.","Lubbers, Ronnie J M","Fungal Genetics and Biotechnology Group, Institute of Biology, Leiden University, Sylviusweg 72, 2333 BE Leiden, The Netherlands.",Microorganisms,Microorganisms,,2025,07,22,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40871222,10.3390/microorganisms13081718,40871222,0,0,NONE

40871260,Complete Genome Analysis and Antimicrobial Mechanism of <i>Burkholderia gladioli</i> ZBSF BH07 Reveal Its Dual Role in the Biocontrol of Grapevine Diseases and Growth Promotion in Grapevines.,"<i>Burkholderia gladioli</i> is a multifaceted bacterium with both pathogenic and beneficial strains, and nonpathogenic <i>Burkholderia</i> species have shown potential as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) and biocontrol agents. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their beneficial functions remain poorly characterized. This study systematically investigated the antimicrobial mechanisms and plant growth-promoting properties of <i>B. gladioli</i> strain ZBSF BH07, isolated from the grape rhizosphere, by combining genomic and functional analyses, including whole-genome sequencing, gene annotation, phylogenetic and comparative genomics, in vitro antifungal assays, and plant growth promotion evaluations. The results showed that ZBSF BH07 exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity, inhibiting 14 grape pathogens with an average inhibition rate of 56.58% and showing dual preventive/curative effects against grape white rot, while also significantly promoting grape seedling growth with increases of 54.9% in plant height, 172.9% in root fresh weight, and 231.34% in root dry weight. Genomic analysis revealed an 8.56-Mb genome (two chromosomes and one plasmid) encoding 7431 genes and 26 secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters (predominantly nonribosomal peptide synthetases), supporting its capacity for antifungal metabolite secretion, and functional analysis confirmed genes for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production. These results demonstrate that ZBSF BH07 suppresses pathogens via antifungal metabolites and enhances grape growth through phytohormone regulation and nutrient acquisition, providing novel insights into the dual mechanisms of <i>B. gladioli</i> as a biocontrol and growth-promoting agent and laying a scientific foundation for developing sustainable grapevine disease management strategies.","Yin, Xiangtian; Wang, Chundong; Yuan, Lifang; Wei, Yanfeng; Li, Tinggang; Liu, Qibao; Han, Xing; Wu, Xinying; Wang, Chaoping; Jiang, Xilong","Shandong Academy of Grape, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China.; Shandong Key Laboratory for Green Prevention and Control of Agricultural Pests, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jinan 250100, China.",Microorganisms,Microorganisms,,2025,07,28,2025,09,14,"CXGC2025C15, CXGC2025A06_NONE_Innovation Project of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences_; 32402337_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; SDAIT-06-21_NONE_Fruit Industrial Technology System of Shandong Province_; SDNYXTTG-2024-26_NONE_Shandong Province Major Agricultural Technology Collaborative Extension Program Project_",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40871260,10.3390/microorganisms13081756,40871260,0,0,NONE
40871307,The Role of Genomic Islands in the Pathogenicity and Evolution of Plant-Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria.,"Genomic islands (GIs) including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), prophages, and integrative plasmids are central drivers of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial plant pathogens. These elements often carry cargo genes encoding virulence factors, antibiotic and metal resistance determinants, and metabolic functions that enhance environmental adaptability. In plant-pathogenic species such as <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, GIs contribute to host specificity, immune evasion, and the emergence of novel pathogenic variants. ICE<i>clc</i> and its homologs represent integrative and mobilizable elements whose tightly regulated excision and transfer are driven by a specialized transcriptional cascade, while ICEs in <i>P. syringae</i> highlight the ecological impact of cargo genes on pathogen virulence and fitness. Pathogenicity islands further modulate virulence gene expression in response to in planta stimuli. Beyond <i>P. syringae</i>, GIs in genera such as <i>Erwinia</i>, <i>Pectobacterium</i>, and <i>Ralstonia</i> underpin critical traits like toxin biosynthesis, secretion system acquisition, and topoisomerase-mediated stability. Leveraging high-throughput genomics and structural biology will be essential to dissect GI regulation and develop targeted interventions to curb disease spread. This review synthesizes the current understanding of GIs in plant-pathogenic gammaproteobacteria and outlines future research priorities for translating mechanistic insights into sustainable disease control strategies.","Watanabe, Yuta; Ishiga, Yasuhiro; Sakata, Nanami","Faculty of Agriculture, Okayama University, 1-1-1 Tsushima-naka, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.; Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba 305-8572, Japan.; The Graduate School of Environmental, Life, Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, 1-1-1 Tsushima-naka, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.",Microorganisms,Microorganisms,,2025,08,01,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40871307,10.3390/microorganisms13081803,40871307,0,0,NONE
40871315,Unveiling the Genetic Landscape of Canine Papillomavirus in the Brazilian Amazon.,"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses known to induce a variety of epithelial lesions in dogs, ranging from benign hyperplasia to malignancies. In regions of rich biodiversity such as the Western Amazon, data on the circulation and genetic composition of canine papillomaviruses (CPVs) remain scarce. This study investigated CPV types present in oral and cutaneous papillomatous lesions in domiciled dogs from Acre and Rondônia States, Brazil. Sixty-one dogs with macroscopically consistent lesions were clinically evaluated, and tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination and PCR targeting the <i>L1</i> gene. Among these, 37% were histologically diagnosed as squamous papillomas or fibropapillomas, and 49.2% (30/61) tested positive for papillomavirus DNA. Sequencing of the <i>L1</i> gene revealed that most positive samples belonged to CPV1 (<i>Lambdapapillomavirus</i> 2), while one case was identified as CPV8 (<i>Chipapillomavirus</i> 3). Complete genomes of three CPV1 strains were obtained via high-throughput sequencing and showed high identity with CPV1 strains from other Brazilian regions. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed close genetic relationships among isolates across distinct geographic areas. These findings demonstrate the circulation of genetically conserved CPVs in the Amazon and reinforce the value of molecular and histopathological approaches for the accurate diagnosis and surveillance of viral diseases in domestic dogs, especially in ecologically complex regions.","Sousa, Jeneffer Caroline de Macêdo; Lins, André de Medeiros Costa; Souza, Fernanda Dos Anjos; Manoel, Higor Ortiz; de Araújo, Cleyton Silva; Tomaya, Lorena Yanet Cáceres; Gasparotto, Paulo Henrique Gilio; Pereira, Vyctoria Malayhka de Abreu Góes; Pacheco, Acácio Duarte; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Silva, Mariana Soares da; Salvarani, Felipe Masiero; Canal, Cláudio Wageck; Silva, Flavio Roberto Chaves da; Daudt, Cíntia","Laboratório de Virologia Geral e Parasitologia, Centro de Ciências Biológicas e da Natureza, Universidade Federal do Acre, Campus Universitário, BR 364, Km 04-Distrito Industrial, Rio Branco 69920-900, AC, Brazil.; Laboratório de Virologia, Faculdade de Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Av.

In response to this pressing environmental issue, the development of innovative remediation strategies has become imperative. Bioremediation technology is characterized by remarkable advantages, including its ecological friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and operational efficiency. In our previous research, <i>Rossellomorea</i> sp. ZC255 demonstrated substantial potential for environmental bioremediation applications. This study investigated the removal characteristics and underlying mechanism of strain ZC255 and revealed that the maximum removal capacity was 253.4 mg/g biomass under the optimal conditions (pH 7.0, 28 °C, and 2% inoculum). The assessment of the biosorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, while the adsorption isotherm may fit well with both the Langmuir and Freundlich models.

40871359,Genomic Epidemiology of ESBL- and Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacterales in a Spanish Hospital: Exploring the Clinical-Environmental Interface.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly due to extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases (CPs), poses a critical threat to global health. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology, resistance profiles, and genomic features of ESBL- and CP-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumonaie</i> (ESBL/CP-Ec/Kp) isolates from a Spanish hospital (2020-2024) and explore links to environmental reservoirs like white storks foraging at a nearby landfill. A total of 121 clinical Ec/Kp isolates (55 ESBL-Ec, 1 CP-Ec, 35 ESBL-Kp, 17 CP-Kp, 13 ESBL+CP-Kp) underwent phenotypic testing, PCR, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Analyses included phylogenomics (cgMLST), detection of AMR genes, plasmid typing, and comparative genomics. Among ESBL-Ec, <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> was the most prevalent (60.0%), and one CP-Ec carrying <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-5</sub> was identified. WGS of 44 selected ESBL/CP-Ec isolates revealed a variety of AMR genes, and 56.8% of isolates carried class one integrons (56.8%). IncF-type plasmids predominated, and 84.1% of isolates were assigned as ExPEC/UPEC. The lineage ST131 dominated (75%), with IncF-<i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>-carrying plasmids. Among the 18 ESBL/CP-Kp isolates sequenced, the lineage ST307 was the most frequent (44.4%), followed by ST15 and ST11, carrying a diversity of AMR determinants and plasmids (IncFIB(K), IncL, ColpVC). Virulence included <i>ybt</i> loci in ICEKp; hypervirulence genes were absent. Genomic analysis of 62 clinical isolates (44 Ec, 18 Kp) showed close phylogenetic links to stork-derived strains, with ST131-Ec and ST307-Kp from humans and birds differing just by ≤22 and ≤10 ADs, respectively, with a conserved plasmid content (i.e., IncL-<i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub>, IncFIB(K)-<i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>). High-risk ESBL/CP-Ec/Kp clones persist across clinical and environmental contexts. WGS-based surveillance is key for understanding AMR spread and guiding interventions.

40871370,Genomic Characterization of Marine <i>Staphylococcus shinii</i> Strain SC-M1C: Potential Genetic Adaptations and Ecological Role.,"<i>Staphylococcus shinii</i> (<i>S. shinii</i>) is a coagulase-negative species primarily associated with the degradation of organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in natural environments. This species has been mainly studied in clinical and terrestrial contexts, with no previous reports of its presence in marine environments. In this study, we report the first isolation of <i>S. shinii</i> from a marine habitat. The strain SC-M1C was isolated from the Red Sea sponge <i>Negombata magnifica</i>. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed its taxonomic identity as <i>S. shinii</i>. The genome uncovers potential adaptive characteristics that facilitate survival in marine ecosystems, comprising genes associated with osmoregulation, nutrient acquisition, stress response, and resistance to heavy metals. Moreover, multiple genomic islands and plasmids were identified, suggesting a potential role in horizontal gene transfer and environmental adaptability. The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters linked to non-ribosomal peptides, siderophores, and terpene production indicates potential for biochemical versatility beyond traditional metabolic expectations. This study presents the first genomic insights into <i>S. shinii</i> in a marine context, highlighting its ecological significance and adaptive mechanisms in a high-salinity environment. These findings expand our understanding of staphylococcal ecology beyond terrestrial and clinical origins and provide a foundation for exploring the role of <i>S. shinii</i> in marine microbial interactions and environmental resilience.","El Samak, Manar; Lotfy, Hasnaa; Sedeek, Abdelrahman M; Mohamed, Yehia S; Solyman, Samar M","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo 11562, Egypt.; Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Galala University, New Galala City 43511, Egypt.; Department of Pathological Sciences, College of Medicine, Ajman University, Ajman P.O.

40871392,"<i>Alteromonas nitratireducens</i> sp. nov., a Novel Nitrate-Reducing Bacterium Isolated from Marine Sediments, and the Evolution of Nitrate-Reducing Genes in the Genus <i>Alteromonas</i>.","Nitrate reduction serves as a pivotal process in the global nitrogen cycle, playing a crucial role in natural ecosystems and industrial applications. Although the genus <i>Alteromonas</i> is not traditionally regarded as a nitrate reducer, several <i>Alteromonas</i> strains have recently been found to be capable of doing so. However, the evolutionary trajectory of this capability remains undiscovered. In this study, 32 bacterial strains were isolated and cultivated from the tidal flat sediment in Hangzhou Bay and classified into the classes <i>Cytophagia</i> (n = 2), <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> (n = 2), <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> (n = 17), <i>Flavobacteriia</i> (n = 5), and <i>Bacilli</i> (n = 6). One nitrate-reducing strain, designated as CYL-A6<sup>T</sup>, was identified by polyphasic taxonomy and proposed as a novel <i>Alteromonas</i> species. Genomic analysis reveals that seven <i>Alteromonas</i> genomes encode the dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes <i>narGHI</i>. Evolutionary analysis showed that these three nitrate-reducing genes were present in the early common ancestor of the genus <i>Alteromonas</i>, while gene loss events occurred in the subsequent evolution. With the loss of nitrate-reducing genes in the ancestry nodes, a wide variety of genes related to energy production and conversion, as well as carbohydrate, nucleotide, coenzyme, and inorganic ion metabolism, were gained in those nodes, which enabled <i>Alteromonas</i> members to utilize diverse substrates for increased energy production. This study enhances the understanding of microbial diversity in marine tidal flat sediments, proposes a novel nitrate-reducing species of the genus <i>Alteromonas</i>, and highlights the ecological diversification and ecological niche breadth in the evolution of the microbial metabolic network.","Chang, Ying-Li; Li, Jia-Xi; Wang, Xing-Chen; Li, Yang; Cao, Yun-Fei; Duan, Xiang-Wen; Sun, Cong; Chen, Can; Xu, Lin","College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China.; Shaoxing Biomedical Research Institute of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Co., Ltd., Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for the Development Technology of Medicinal and Edible Homologous Health Food, Shaoxing 312075, China.; College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.",Microorganisms,Microorganisms,,2025,08,13,2025,09,14,U23A2034_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 2023YFC2811400_NONE_National Key R&D Program of China_; TGS24C010002_NONE_Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_; 22408326_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; 2022YFC2803900_NONE_National Key R&D Program of China_; LY24D060001_NONE_Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40871392,10.3390/microorganisms13081888,40871392,0,0,NONE
40871443,PapB Family Regulators as Master Switches of Fimbrial Expression.,"Some bacterial species within the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family possess different types of fimbrial (pili) adhesins that promote adherence to cells and colonization of host tissues. One of the well-characterized fimbrial systems is the <i>pap</i> operon, which encodes P fimbriae, a key virulence factor in urinary and systemic infections. One of the key regulators of P fimbriae is the transcriptional regulator PapB which plays a pivotal role as a master switch, not only by directing phase-variable expression of its own operon but also by influencing expression of heterologous fimbrial systems. This review explores the structural organization, biogenesis, and multi-tiered regulatory control of P fimbriae, with emphasis on PapB and homologous regulatory proteins such as SfaB, FocB, PixB, and PefB. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses reveal that regulators belonging to the PapB family are evolutionarily conserved across π-fimbrial systems and also regulate other types of fimbriae. These regulators respond to epigenetic changes, host-derived signals, and global transcriptional cues to control levels of production of specific fimbriae in a bacterial population to dynamically modulate bacterial adhesion in different environmental niches. Optimally, understanding these mechanisms could lead to novel approaches to perturb PapB-family proteins and abrogate production of some types of fimbriae as a targeted strategy to prevent bacterial infections dependent on adherence mediated by PapB family regulators.","Akrami, Fariba; Jamali, Hossein; Kodori, Mansoor; Dozois, Charles M","Noncommunicable Diseases Research Centre, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam 7661771967, Iran.; Centre de Recherche en Infectiologie Porcine et Avicole (CRIPA), Faculté de Médecine Vétérinaire, Université de Montréal Saint-Hyacinthe, Saint-Hyacinthe, QC J2S 2M2, Canada.; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Centre Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie, 531 Boul des Prairies, Laval, QC H7V 1B7, Canada.",Microorganisms,Microorganisms,,2025,08,20,2025,09,15,RGPIN-2025-07045_NONE_Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40871443,10.3390/microorganisms13081939,40871443,0,0,NONE
40871444,Functional Genomic Characteristics of Marine Sponge-Associated <i>Microbulbifer spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup>.,"The genus <i>Microbulbifer</i> comprises a group of marine, gram-negative bacteria known for their remarkable ability to adapt to a variety of environments. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and metabolic characteristics of <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> and three <i>Microbulbifer</i> reference strains by genomic and comparative genomic analysis. Compared to free-living reference strains, the lower GC content, higher number of strain-specific genes, pseudogenes, unique paralogs, dispensable genes, and mobile gene elements (MGEs) such as genomic islands (GIs) and insertion sequence (IS) elements, while the least number of CAZymes, indicates that <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> may be a facultative sponge-symbiont. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> possesses a plasmid and a higher number of strain-specific genes than <i>Microbulbifer</i> reference strains, showing that <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> may have acquired unique genes to adapt sponge-host environment. Moreover, there are differences in the functional distribution of genes belonging to different COG-classes in four <i>Microbulbifer</i> strains. COG-functional analysis reveals a lower number of strain-specific genes associated with metabolism, energy production, and motility in <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> compared to <i>Microbulbifer</i> reference strains, suggesting that sponge-associated lifestyle may force this bacterium to acquire nutrients from the sponge host and loss motility genes. Finally, we found that several proteins associated with oxidative stress response (sodC, katA, catA, bcp, trmH, cspA), osmotic stress response (dsbG, ampG, amiD_2, czcA, czcB, and corA), and tolerance to biotoxic metal proteins (dsbG, ampG, amiD_2, czcA, czcB, and corA) are absent in <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> but present in <i>Microbulbifer</i> reference strains, indicating that <i>M. spongiae</i> MI-G<sup>T</sup> live in a stable and less stress environment provided by the sponge host than free-living <i>Microbulbifer</i> strains.

40805662,Establishment of an Efficient <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i>-Mediated Hairy Root Transformation System for Functional Analysis in Passion Fruit.,"Passion fruit (<i>Passiflora edulis</i> Sims), belonging to the Passifloraceae family, is an economically important plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The advances in functional genomics research of passion fruit have been significantly hindered by its recalcitrance to regeneration and stable transformation. This study establishes the first efficient <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i>-mediated hairy root transformation system for passion fruit. Utilizing the <i>eGFP</i> marker gene, transformation efficiencies of 11.3% were initially achieved with strains K599, MSU440, and C58C1, with K599 proving most effective. Key transformation parameters were systematically optimized to achieve the following: OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6, infection duration 30 min, acetosyringone concentration 100 μM, and a dark co-cultivation period of 2 days. The system's utility was further enhanced by incorporating the red visual marker RUBY, enabling direct, instrument-free identification of transgenic roots via betaxanthin accumulation. Finally, this system was applied for functional analysis using <i>PeMYB123</i>, which may be involved in proanthocyanidin accumulation.

40805713,Harnessing Molecular Phylogeny and Chemometrics for Taxonomic Validation of Korean Aromatic Plants: Integrating Genomics with Practical Applications.,"Plant genetics and chemotaxonomic analysis are considered key parameters in understanding evolution, plant diversity and adaptation. Korean Peninsula has a unique biogeographical landscape that supports various aromatic plant species, each with considerable ecological, ethnobotanical, and pharmacological significance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the chemotaxonomic traits, biological activities, phylogenetic relationships and potential applications of Korean aromatic plants, highlighting their significance in more accurate identification. Chemotaxonomic investigations employing techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have enabled the identification of essential oils and specialized metabolites that serve as valuable taxonomic and diagnostic markers. These chemical traits play essential roles in species delimitation and in clarifying interspecific variation. The biological activities of selected taxa are reviewed, with emphasis on antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic effects, supported by bioassay-guided fractionation and compound isolation. In parallel, recent advances in phylogenetic reconstruction employing DNA barcoding, internal transcribed spacer regions, and chloroplast genes such as <i>rbcL</i> and <i>matK</i> are examined for their role in clarifying taxonomic uncertainties and inferring evolutionary lineages. Overall, the search period was from year 2001 to 2025 and total of 268 records were included in the study. By integrating phytochemical profiling, pharmacological evidence, and molecular systematics, this review highlights the multifaceted significance of Korean endemic aromatic plants. The conclusion highlights the importance of multidisciplinary approaches including metabolomics and phylogenomics in advancing our understanding of species diversity, evolutionary adaptation, and potential applications.

40805753,Integrative Population Genomics Reveals Niche Differentiation and Gene Flow in Chinese Sclerophyllous Oaks (<i>Quercus</i> Sect. <i>Ilex</i>).,"Elucidating the coexistence mechanisms of rapidly diverging species has long been a challenge in evolutionary biology. Genome-wide polymorphic loci are expected to provide insights into the speciation processes of these closely related species. This study focused on seven Chinese sclerophyllous oaks, represented by <i>Quercus spinosa</i>, <i>Quercus aquifolioides</i>, <i>Quercus rehderiana</i>, <i>Quercus guyavifolia</i>, <i>Quercus monimotricha</i>, <i>Quercus semecarpifolia</i>, and <i>Quercus senescens</i>, employing 27,592 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to examine their phylogenetic relationships at the genomic level. Combined with genetic structure analysis, phylogenetic trees revealed that the genetic clustering of individuals was influenced by both geographic distance and ancestral genetic components. Furthermore, this study confirmed the existence of reticulate evolutionary relationships among the species. Frequent gene flow and introgression within the seven species were primarily responsible for the ambiguous interspecies boundaries, with hybridization serving as a major driver of reticulate evolution. Additionally, the seven species exhibited distinct differences in niche occupancy. By reconstructing the climatic adaptability of ancestral taxonomic units, we found that the climatic tolerance of each species displayed differential responses to 19 climatic factors. Consequently, ecological niche differentiation and variations in habitat adaptation contributed to the preservation of species boundaries. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the speciation processes in rapidly diverging genera and underscores the significance of both genetic and ecological factors in the formation and maintenance of species boundaries.","Ju, Miao-Miao; Yue, Ming; Zhao, Gui-Fang","Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an 710069, China.; Xi'an Botanical Garden of Shaanxi Province (Institute of Botany of Shaanxi Province), Shaanxi Academy of Science, Xi'an 710061, China.","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",Plants (Basel),,2025,08,03,2025,08,17,32101354_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40805753,10.3390/plants14152403,40805753,0,,

This study systematically investigated the evolution and functional specialization of the C3HC4-type RING zinc finger gene family, known to mediate abiotic stress responses through E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, in these contrasting cereal species. Through comparative genomics, we identified 123 <i>HvC3HC4</i> genes and 90 <i>OsC3HC4</i> genes, phylogenetically classified into four conserved subgroups. Differences in <i>C3HC4</i> genes in phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal distribution, gene structure, motif composition, gene duplication events, and <i>cis</i>-elements in the promoter region were observed between barley and rice. Moreover, <i>HvC3HC4s</i> in barley tissues preferentially adopted an energy-conserving strategy, which may be a key mechanism for barley's higher salt tolerance. Additionally, we found that <i>C3HC4</i> genes were evolutionarily conserved in salt-tolerant species.

However, the identification and functional characterization of <i>FBP</i> genes in <i>Saccharum</i> remains limited. In this study, we conducted a systematic identification and comparative genomics analyses of <i>FBPs</i> in three <i>Saccharum</i> species. We further examined their expression patterns across leaf developmental zones, spatiotemporal profiles, and responses to diurnal rhythms and hormonal treatments. Our analysis identified 95 <i>FBP</i> genes, including 44 <i>cyFBPs</i> and 51 <i>cpFBPs</i>. Comparative analyses revealed significant divergence in physicochemical properties, gene structures, and motif compositions between the two isoforms. Expression profiling indicated that both <i>cyFBPs</i> and <i>cpFBPs</i> were predominantly expressed in leaves, particularly in maturing and mature zones. During diurnal cycles, their expression peaked around the night-day transition, with <i>cpFBPs</i> exhibiting earlier peaks than <i>cyFBPs</i>. <i>FBP genes</i> in <i>Saccharum spontaneum</i> displayed greater diurnal sensitivity than those in <i>Saccharum officinarum</i>. Hormonal treatments further revealed significant regulatory divergence in <i>FBP</i> genes, both between isoforms and across species. Notably, <i>cyFBP</i>_<i>2</i> and <i>cpFBP</i>_<i>2</i> members consistently exhibited higher expression levels across all datasets, suggesting their pivotal roles in sugarcane physiology.

Although this is challenging, recent conceptual and technological advances in functional genomics, coupled with computational biology, high-throughput plant phenotyping and artificial intelligence, are now aiding our uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant stress tolerance. Integrating other innovative approaches such as genome editing, modern plant breeding and synthetic biology facilitates the development of climate-smart cereal crops. Here, we discuss major recent advances in plant functional genomic approaches and techniques such as third-generation sequencing, transcriptomics, pangenomes, genome-wide association studies and epigenomics, which have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of stress tolerance and development of stress-resilient cereals. Further, we highlight how these genomics approaches are successfully integrated into new plant breeding methods for effective development of stress-tolerant crops.

40872129,Recent Advances and Developments in Bacterial Endophyte Identification and Application: A 20-Year Landscape Review.,"Bacterial endophytes have emerged as critical components of plant microbiomes, offering multifaceted benefits ranging from growth promotion to stress resilience. This review synthesizes two decades of research, from 2004 to 2024, on bacterial endophyte identification and applications, highlighting advances in both traditional culture-based techniques and modern omics approaches. The review also focuses on interactions between these microorganisms and their host plants, emphasizing their roles in biocontrol, phytoremediation, and nanoparticle biosynthesis. While significant progress has been made in characterizing cultivable bacterial endophytes, challenges persist in accessing unculturable species and understanding strain-specific functional mechanisms. The integration of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics has begun unraveling this hidden diversity, revealing novel metabolic pathways and plant-microbe communication systems. There have been limitations in endophyte isolation protocols and field applications, and therefore a need exists for standardized frameworks to bridge lab-based discoveries with agricultural practices. Cutting-edge multi-omics techniques, such as genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and phenomics, should be used more in future research to clarify the mechanistic underpinnings of plant-endophyte interactions to thoroughly profile the microbial communities and unlock their functional potential under diverse environmental conditions. Overall, bacterial endophytes present viable paths toward sustainable farming methods, supporting food security and crop resilience in the face of environmental difficulties by providing a transformative opportunity for next-generation agriculture, mitigating climate-related agricultural stressors, reducing dependence on synthetic agrochemicals, and enhancing crop productivity.","Mametja, Neo M; Ramadwa, Thanyani E; Managa, Muthumuni; Masebe, Tracy M","Department of Life and Consumer Science, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Florida Campus, Johannesburg 1710, South Africa.; Institute for Nanotechnology and Water Sustainability (iNanoWS), College of Science, Engineering and Technology, University of South Africa, Florida Campus, Johannesburg 1710, South Africa.","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",Plants (Basel),,2025,08,12,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40872129,10.3390/plants14162506,40872129,0,0,NONE

As receptors of ABA, pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL) proteins play a central role in initiating ABA signal transduction. In this study, a total of 30 <i>PopPYL</i> genes were identified and classified into three sub-families (PYL I-III) in the pan-genome of 17 <i>Populus</i> species, through phylogenetic analysis. Among these subfamilies, the PYL I subfamily was the largest, comprising 21 members, whereas PYL III was the smallest, with only four members. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of these genes, we conducted synteny and <i>Ka</i>/<i>Ks</i> analyses. Results indicated that most <i>PopPYL</i> genes had undergone purifying selection (<i>Ka</i>/<i>Ks</i> < 1), while a few were subject to positive selection (<i>Ka</i>/<i>Ks</i> > 1). Promoter analysis revealed 258 <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in the <i>PYL</i> genes of <i>Populus euphratica</i> (EUP) and <i>Populus pruinosa</i> (PRU), including 127 elements responsive to abiotic stress and 33 ABA-related elements. Furthermore, six structural variations (SVs) were detected in <i>PYL_EUP</i> genes and significantly influenced gene expression levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). To further explore the functional roles of <i>PYL</i> genes, we analyzed tissue-specific expression profiles of 17 <i>PYL_EUP</i> genes under drought stress conditions. <i>PYL6_EUP</i> was predominantly expressed in roots, <i>PYL17_EUP</i> exhibited leaf-specific expression, and <i>PYL1_EUP</i> showed elevated expression in stems. These findings suggest that the drought response of <i>PYL_EUP</i> genes is tissue-specific.

However, the limited data obtained through this approach constrain its application in the mechanistic analysis of pollutant toxicity. Omics technologies have emerged as a major research focus in recent years, enabling the comprehensive and accurate analysis of biomolecular-level changes. The integration of multi-omics technologies can holistically reveal the molecular toxicity mechanisms of pollutants, representing a primary emphasis in current toxicological research.

40872810,New Isolates of Betachloroviruses Shed Light on the Diversity and Biological Complexity of an Unexplored Group of Giant Algal Viruses.,"The majority of giant algal viruses belong to the family <i>Phycodnaviridae</i>, class <i>Algavirales</i>, phylum <i>Nucleocytoviricota</i>. Among them, the genus <i>Chlorovirus</i> is the most studied, with three recognized groups based on genomics and host range, although many fundamental questions remain to be elucidated, particularly regarding their diversity. In this study, we focus on betachloroviruses, a poorly explored subgroup that infects the alga <i>Micractinium conductrix</i> Pbi. Here, we describe the isolation and genomic analysis of 11 new betachloroviruses from water samples collected in Nebraska, USA. With 25 fully sequenced genomes now available, we assessed the genomic diversity of these viruses. They have double-stranded DNA genomes ranging from 295 to 374 kbp, encoding hundreds of ORFs, of which a large number (~40%) lack known function. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses revealed three species of betachlorovirus, each with high intra-species genomic identity. Notably, some isolates with over 99.5% genomic identity display markedly different plaque phenotypes, which led us to propose the use of the term genomovar among giant algal viruses, a concept potentially applicable to other giant viral groups yet to be explored. Altogether, this work advances our understanding of betachloroviruses and highlights the importance of linking viral genotype to phenotype, opening new avenues for exploring the diversity of giant algal viruses.","Souza, Júlia W; Henriques, Lethícia R; Carlson, Roger M; Botelho, Bruna B F; Carvalho, João Victor R P; Santos, João Pedro N; Aguiar, Eric R G R; Agarkova, Irina V; Van Etten, James L; Dunigan, David D; Rodrigues, Rodrigo A L","Laboratório de Bioinformática de Vírus, Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Ilhéus 45662-900, BA, Brazil.; Nebraska Center for Virology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0900, USA.; Núcleo de Apoio Técnico ao Ensino, Pesquisa e Extensão, Instituto de Ciências Ambientais, Químicas e Farmacêuticas, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Diadema 09913-030, SP, Brazil.; Department of Plant Pathology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0722, USA.; Laboratório de Vírus, Departamento de Microbiologia, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte 31270-901, MG, Brazil.",Viruses,Viruses,"Phylogeny, Genome, Viral, Phycodnaviridae, Genetic Variation, Genomics, Open Reading Frames",2025,08,08,2025,08,31,402038/2023-1_NONE_National Council for Scientific and Technological Development_; APQ-01057-23_NONE_Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais_; Finance Code 001_NONE_Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior_; 1736030_NONE_U.S. National Science Foundation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40872810,10.3390/v17081096,,,,
40872665,"Genomic Adaptation, Environmental Challenges, and Sustainable Yak Husbandry in High-Altitude Pastoral Systems.","The yak (<i>Bos grunniens</i>) is a key species in high-altitude rangelands of Asia. Despite their ecological and economic importance, yak production faces persistent challenges, including low milk yields, vulnerability to climate changes, emerging diseases, and a lack of systematic breeding programs. This review presents the genomic, physiological, and environmental dimensions of yak biology and husbandry. Genes such as <i>EPAS1</i>, which encodes hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, underpin physiological adaptations, including enlarged cardiopulmonary structures, elevated erythrocyte concentrations, and specialized thermoregulatory mechanisms that enable their survival at elevations of 3000 m and above. Copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present promising markers for improving milk and meat production, disease resistance, and metabolic efficiency. F1 and F2 generations of yak-cattle hybrids show superior growth and milk yields, but reproductive barriers, such as natural mating or artificial insemination, and environmental factors limit the success of these hybrids beyond second generation. Infectious diseases, such as bovine viral diarrhea and antimicrobial-resistant and biofilm-forming <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>E. coli</i>, pose risks to herd health and food safety. Rising ambient temperatures, declining forage biomass, and increased disease prevalence due to climate changes risk yak economic performance and welfare. Addressing these challenges by nutritional, environmental, and genetic interventions will safeguard yak pastoralism. This review describes the genes associated with different yak traits and provides an overview of the genetic adaptations of yaks (<i>Bos grunniens</i>) to environmental stresses at high altitudes and emphasizes the need for conservation and improvement strategies for sustainable husbandry of these yaks.","Naz, Saima; Chatha, Ahmad Manan Mustafa; Ullah, Qudrat; Farooq, Muhammad; Jamil, Tariq; Muner, Raja Danish; Kiran, Azka","Department of Zoology, Government Sadiq College Women University, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.; Department of Soil Plant and Food Science, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Via Giovanni Amendola, 165/a, 70121 Bari, Italy.; Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics, The University of Agriculture, Dera Ismail Khan 29111, Pakistan.; Independent Researcher, 07743 Jena, Germany.; Department of Theriogenology, Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.; Department of Entomology, Faculty of Agriculture and Environment, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.",Veterinary sciences,Vet Sci,,2025,07,29,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40872665,10.3390/vetsci12080714,40872665,0,0,NONE

Relevant medical history, clinical features, laboratory tests, and genetic results were analyzed. The two male patients, aged 7 years (case 1) and 15 years (case 2), initially presented with generalized skin hyperpigmentation, without any family history of similar disorders. Both had normal growth and development, and adrenal CT and brain MRI revealed no significant abnormalities. Elevated very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels were detected. Genetic analyses identified a maternally inherited missense mutation (c.830G>A, p.Gly277Glu) in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) gene in case 1, and a missense mutation (c.1499G>T, p.Gly500Val) in case 2. Protein structural predictions indicated both mutations as potentially damaging or damaging, and both were classified as likely pathogenic according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria (PM1/PM2/PP3_Moderate and PM2/PP3_Moderate/PM6, respectively), supporting their correlation with the clinical phenotype. Clinicians should maintain vigilance for X-ALD in male patients presenting with Addison's disease, and combined VLCFA and genetic testing can effectively prevent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.","Yin, Y Q; Li, L Q; Cheng, Y; Zang, L; Gu, W J; Lyu, Z H; Mu, Y M","Department of Endocrinology, Baoding No. 1 Central Hospital, Baoding 071000, China.; Department of Endocrinology, the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100039, China.",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Humans, Male, Adrenoleukodystrophy, ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily D, Member 1, Addison Disease, Child, Adolescent, Mutation, Missense, ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters, Mutation",2025,08,19,2025,09,17,51511222A_NONE_Key Medical Disciplines Project of the PLA Joint Logistic Support Force_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40904295,10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20250515-00280,40904295,0,0,NONE

Data from this pedigree were collected, organized, and analyzed for clinical genetic characteristics. Medical histories were obtained from family members, pedigree charts were drawn, audiological, imaging, and physical examinations were conducted. Pathogenic genes and mutations were screened using high-throughput sequencing. Sanger sequencing was employed for variant confirmation and segregation validation in the family. <b>Results:</b> In this family, a total of 12 members (10 members collected) had sensorineural hearing loss, characterized by late-onset hearing impairment with an onset age ranging from 9 to 30 years. The patients exhibited poor speech recognition rates, and audiometric examinations are consistent with auditory neuropathy. There was no history of ototoxic drug use. High-throughput sequencing identified the variant NC_012920.1:m.7471dup in the mitochondrial <i>MT-TS1</i> gene as the pathogenic variant. Sanger sequencing results confirmed that the pathogenic gene mutation site perfectly co-segregated with the auditory neuropathy phenotype in this family. According to the classification criteria and guidelines for genetic variations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the variant was classified as a pathogenic mutation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The mitochondrial <i>MT-TS1</i> gene mutation m.7471dup is considered to be the pathogenic cause in this late-onset auditory neuropathy pedigree.","Wang, Y N; Zhang, T; Wang, H J; Deng, Z; Chen, D J; Zhang, X M; Seng, D J; Xu, H E; Tang, W X; Zhang, J; Wang, S F","BGI College and Henan Institute of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.; Institute of Pediatrics, the Affiliated Children Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.; Precision Medicine Center, Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, the Affiliated Children Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,"Humans, Pedigree, Male, Mutation, Adult, Hearing Loss, Sensorineural, Hearing Loss, Central, Age of Onset, DNA, Mitochondrial, Child, Female, Mitochondria, Young Adult",2025,09,01,2025,09,01,82371160_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40890060,10.3760/cma.j.cn115330-20240924-00541,,,,
40853860,A Comprehensive Protocol and Step-by-Step Guide for Multi-Omics Integration in Biological Research.,"This manuscript provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for integrating multi-omics data in biological research. Multi-omics data integration refers to the process of combining and analyzing data measured on the same set of biological samples with different omics technologies, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiomes, lipidomics, and glycomics. Even though multi-omics approaches have similar objectives as single-block or single-omics analyses (for instance, description, discrimination, classification, or prediction), they are able to capture a broader spectrum of molecular information, thus providing a deeper understanding of biological systems and their complex interactions. Indeed, the combination of multiple-omics datasets enables the improvement of prediction accuracy and yields more robust results, especially in cases where the number of available samples is limited. Moreover, thanks also to the most recent development of machine learning techniques, multi-omics analyses are nowadays suitable to uncover hidden patterns and complex phenomena arising among different biological compounds. The primary aim of this work is to present the full protocol that is commonly used in multi-omics studies, from the initial formulation of the problem to the tools useful for the biological interpretation of the results. The manuscript describes in detail the various methods of integrating multi-omics data, including concatenation-based (low-level), transformation-based (mid-level), and model-based (high-level) approaches, and highlights their limitations and advantages, along with the presentation of general visualization and diagnostic tools.","Adam, Elodie; Zanoaga, Mihaela-Diana; Rota, Riccardo; Cominetti, Ornella","Nestlé Institute of Food Safety & Analytical Sciences, Nestlé Research; Ornella.Cominetti@rd.nestle.com.; Nestlé Institute of Food Safety & Analytical Sciences, Nestlé Research.; Nestlé Institute of Food Safety & Analytical Sciences, Nestlé Research; D-USYS, ETH Zürich.; Statistical Genetics Group, University of Lausanne (UNIL).",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,J Vis Exp,"Genomics, Metabolomics, Proteomics, Humans, Computational Biology, Multiomics",2025,08,08,2025,08,25,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40853860,10.3791/66995,40853860,0,0,NONE

40882152,A review of the microbiome's role in resistance evolution and life-history trait variation in mosquitoes.,"Vector control programs have historically relied on chemical insecticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids but the rapid escalation of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations now threatens the sustainability of these interventions. While genetic and biochemical resistance mechanisms are well characterized, emerging evidence implicates the mosquito microbiome as an additional, underexplored factor influencing resistance. Several microbial taxa (Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas spp., Wolbachia) have been associated with detoxification pathways, yet causal links between these microbiota and specific resistance phenotypes remain weakly defined. Furthermore, the extent to which microbiome shifts modulate mosquito life-history traits such as survival, fecundity, and development time under sustained insecticide selection remains largely unknown. These traits are key determinants of vectorial capacity, and microbiome-mediated changes could alter disease transmission dynamics in ways not currently accounted for in control strategies. This review critically synthesizes evidence from 2005-2024, drawing on peer-reviewed studies, systematic reviews, and experimental work from NCBI, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. We evaluate the interplay between insecticide-driven selection, microbiome composition, and mosquito biology, highlighting mechanistic uncertainties, methodological limitations, and gaps in longitudinal validation. The analysis underscores the urgent need for integrative research combining microbiome manipulation, functional genomics, and ecological monitoring to move from correlation to causation. By clarifying the microbiome-resistance nexus, this work aims to inform more sustainable, evidence-based strategies for long-term vector control.","Kataki, Aditya Shankar","School of Biodiversity, One health and Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow; Scotland, United Kingdom.",Journal of vector borne diseases,J Vector Borne Dis,,2025,08,29,2025,08,29,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40882152,10.4103/jvbd.Jvbd_147_25,,,,
40888375,A Rare <i>TERT</i> Mutation Associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and COPD in a Chinese Family.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive lung scarring. It involves destruction of the alveolar architecture, thickening of the basement membrane, abnormal deposition of the extracellular matrix, inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitial space, and formation of fibroblast foci. Mutations in <i>telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)</i> have been reported to be associated with IPF. To explore the genetic cause of a family affected by IPF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cross-sectional study. Whole-exome sequencing combined with IPF candidate gene filtering was used to identify the causative mutations. Sanger sequencing was applied to validate the mutation and perform c-segregation analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to analyze the telomere lengths of family members. We identified a rare mutation, c.2669G > A (p. Gly890Asp), in <i>TERT</i> (NM_198253.2) in the proband and another affected family member. Bioinformatics analysis predicted this mutation to be deleterious, and structural modeling suggested that it altered the structure and surface charge distribution of the <i>TERT</i> protein. Additionally, real-time PCR demonstrated that mutation carriers had significantly shorter telomere lengths compared with individuals of the same age. According to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, this rare mutation was classified as likely pathogenic. This is the first reported case of IPF caused by the p. Gly890Asp mutation of <i>TERT</i> in the Chinese population. Our findings support the diagnosis of IPF in the patient and further highlight the role of <i>TERT</i> in the disease.","Fan, Liang-Liang; Feng, Dong-Cai; Long, Jie-Yi; Zhang, Ai-Qin","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, China.",Balkan medical journal,Balkan Med J,"Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, China, Cross-Sectional Studies, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Mutation, Pedigree, Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive, Telomerase, East Asian People",2025,09,01,2025,09,04,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40888375,10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2025.2025-6-142,40888375,0,0,NONE

40786240,Beyond Hypomethylating Agents: Novel Therapies and Targeted Approaches.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic diseases sharing ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and a high risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The current MDS classification systems, such as the International Consensus Classification (ICC) and the WHO 2022 classification, have incorporated molecular and cytogenetic markers to improve the stratification of risk and guide therapy. However, treatment options for high-risk MDS (HR-MDS) remain limited, with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) providing only modest survival benefits. Emerging treatments such as immune checkpoint blockade and novel targeted therapies could further improve patient outcomes. While early excitement was significant, clinical trials of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ipilimumab and durvalumab have produced no definitive results, highlighting the need for better patient selection and combination regimens. Emerging drugs luspatercept and imetelstat have been suggested for lower-risk MDS (LR-MDS) by promoting transfusion independence and global hematologic response. In contrast, exploratory agents such as pevonedistat, magrolimab, and sabatolimab are under further investigation for HR-MDS. The future of MDS treatment currently addresses precision medicine, in which molecular characterization guides therapeutic options. Identification of predictive biomarkers for response to targeted therapies and immunotherapies is crucial to optimize patient outcomes. An integrated, patient-centered approach combining genomics, novel therapeutics, and immunomodulation is therefore essential to address the current needs in MDS management.","Cortiana, Viviana; Vallabhaneni, Harshitha; Ghazal, Jenna; Itodo, Kennedy; Kassim Dohadwala, Taha; Park, Chandler; Leyfman, Yan","David Tvildiani Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia.; Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences (DIMEC), University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.; Kalamazoo Valley Community College, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA.; Norton Cancer Institute, Louisville, KY, USA.; Nigerian Institute Ffor Trypanosomiasis Research, Jos, Nigeria.; NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, NY, USA.; Apollo Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Hyderabad, India.",Clinical hematology international,Clin Hematol Int,,2025,08,07,2025,08,13,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40786240,10.46989/001c.142956,40786240,0,,

40887192,[Brain midline segmentation method based on prior knowledge and path optimization].,"To address the challenges faced by current brain midline segmentation techniques, such as insufficient accuracy and poor segmentation continuity, this paper proposes a deep learning network model based on a two-stage framework. On the first stage of the model, prior knowledge of the feature consistency of adjacent brain midline slices under normal and pathological conditions is utilized. Associated midline slices are selected through slice similarity analysis, and a novel feature weighting strategy is adopted to collaboratively fuse the overall change characteristics and spatial information of these associated slices, thereby enhancing the feature representation of the brain midline in the intracranial region. On the second stage, the optimal path search strategy for the brain midline is employed based on the network output probability map, which effectively addresses the problem of discontinuous midline segmentation. The method proposed in this paper achieved satisfactory results on the CQ500 dataset provided by the Center for Advanced Research in Imaging, Neurosciences and Genomics, New Delhi, India. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and normalized surface Dice (NSD) were 67.38 ± 10.49, 24.22 ± 24.84, 1.33 ± 1.83, and 0.82 ± 0.09, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can fully utilize the prior knowledge of medical images to effectively achieve accurate segmentation of the brain midline, providing valuable assistance for subsequent identification of the brain midline by clinicians.","Geng, Shuai; Li, Yonghui; Ao, Yu; Shi, Weili; Miao, Yu; Wang, Shuhan; Jiang, Zhengang","School of Computer Science and Technology, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, P.

40879132,Identifying in vivo genetic dependencies of melanocyte and melanoma development.,"The advent of large-scale sequencing in both development and disease has identified large numbers of candidate genes that may be linked to important phenotypes. We have developed a rapid, scalable system for assessing the role of candidate genes using zebrafish. We generated transgenic zebrafish in which Cas9 was knocked in to the endogenous <i>mitfa</i> locus, a master transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage. The main advantage of this system compared to existing techniques is maintenance of endogenous regulatory elements. We used this system to identify both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous regulators of normal melanocyte development. We then applied this to the melanoma setting to demonstrate that loss of genes required for melanocyte survival can paradoxically promote more aggressive phenotypes, highlighting that in vitro screens can mask in vivo phenotypes. Our genetic approach offers a versatile tool for exploring developmental processes and disease mechanisms that can readily be applied to other cell lineages.","Perlee, Sarah; Ma, Yilun; Hunter, Miranda V; Swanson, Jacob B; Cruz, Nelly M; Ming, Zhitao; Xia, Julia; Lionnet, Timothee; McGrail, Maura; White, Richard M","Nuffield Department of Medicine, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, United States.; Institute for Systems Genetics, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, United States.; Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States.; Cell and Developmental Biology Program, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, United States.; Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, United States.; Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States.; Department of Cell Biology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, United States.",eLife,Elife,"Animals, Zebrafish, Melanocytes, Melanoma, Animals, Genetically Modified, Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor, Zebrafish Proteins, CRISPR-Cas Systems",2025,08,29,2025,09,02,DP2CA186572_NH_NIH HHS_United States; F30CA265124_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA229215_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; T32GM007739_NH_NIH HHS_United States; R24 OD020166_OD_NIH HHS_United States; P30 CA008748_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; T32CA254875_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01CA238317_NH_NIH HHS_United States; Core Grant_NONE_Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research_; F31CA271518_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; F31 CA271518_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; 1K99CA266931_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01CA229215_NH_NIH HHS_United States; DP2 CA186572_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; T32 CA254875_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA238317_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; T32 GM007739_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; ORIP R24OD020166_NH_NIH HHS_United States; F30 CA265124_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; K99 CA266931_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40879132,10.7554/eLife.100257,,,,
40827852,Benchmarking and optimization of methods for the detection of identity-by-descent in high-recombining <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> genomes.,"Genomic surveillance is crucial for identifying at-risk populations for targeted malaria control and elimination. Identity-by-descent (IBD) is increasingly being used in <i>Plasmodium</i> population genomics to estimate genetic relatedness, effective population size (<i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>), population structure, and signals of positive selection. Despite its potential, a thorough evaluation of IBD segment detection tools for species with high recombination rates, such as <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, remains absent. Here, we perform comprehensive benchmarking of IBD callers - probabilistic (<monospace>hmmIBD</monospace>, <monospace>isoRelate</monospace>), identity-by-state-based (<monospace>hap-IBD</monospace>, <monospace>phased IBD</monospace>) and others (<monospace>Refined IBD</monospace>) - using population genetic simulations tailored for high recombination, and IBD quality metrics at both the IBD segment level and the IBD-based downstream inference level. Our results demonstrate that low marker density per genetic unit, related to high recombination relative to mutation, significantly compromises the accuracy of detected IBD segments. In genomes with high recombination rates resembling <i>P. falciparum</i>, most IBD callers exhibit high false negative rates for shorter IBD segments, which can be partially mitigated through optimization of IBD caller parameters, especially those related to marker density. Notably, IBD detected with optimized parameters allows for more accurate capture of selection signals and population structure; IBD-based <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> inference is very sensitive to IBD detection errors, with IBD called from <monospace>hmmIBD</monospace> uniquely providing less biased estimates of <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> in this context. Validation with empirical data from the MalariaGEN <i>Pf</i>7 database, representing different transmission settings, corroborates these findings. We conclude that context-specific evaluation and parameter optimization are essential for accurate IBD detection in high-recombining species and recommend <monospace>hmmIBD</monospace> for <i>Plasmodium</i> species, especially for quality-sensitive analyses, such as estimation of <i>N</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>. Our optimization and high-level benchmarking methods not only improve IBD segment detection in high-recombining genomes but also enhance overall genomic analysis, paving the way for more accurate genomic surveillance and targeted intervention strategies for malaria.","Guo, Bing; Takala-Harrison, Shannon; O'Connor, Timothy D","Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, United States.; Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, United States.",eLife,Elife,"Plasmodium falciparum, Benchmarking, Genome, Protozoan, Recombination, Genetic, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum, Genomics",2025,08,19,2025,09,14,NONE_WT__Wellcome Trust_United Kingdom; 1R01AI145852_NH_NIH HHS_United States; R01 AI145852_AI_NIAID NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827852,10.7554/eLife.101924,40827852,2,,"[40236429, 40630530]"
40900123,DNA methylation insulates genic regions from CTCF loops near nuclear speckles.,"The insulator protein CTCF is essential for mediating chromatin loops and regulating gene expression. While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of 'DNMT1i-specific' CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles - condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust toward the loss of speckles.","Roseman, Shelby A; Siegenfeld, Allison P; Lee, Ceejay; Lue, Nicholas Z; Waterbury, Amanda L; Liau, Brian B","Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, United States.; Harvard University Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cambridge, United States.; University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.",eLife,Elife,"CCCTC-Binding Factor, DNA Methylation, Humans, DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1, Chromatin, Cell Nucleus, Protein Binding, Gene Expression Regulation",2025,09,03,2025,09,05,DGE1745303_NONE_National Science Foundation_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40900123,10.7554/eLife.102930,40900123,0,0,NONE

We showed that an unprecedented number of recurrently evolved mutations in an arthropod pest, the two-spotted spider mite <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, drive the rapid evolution of resistance to a recently commercialized acaricide, cyetpyrafen. We first observed high levels of resistance that appeared and became widespread within three years. Genome scans revealed genetic heterogeneity of resistance among populations and identified 15 target mutations, including six mutations on five amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhB</i>, and nine mutations on three amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhD</i> of the pesticide target succinate dehydrogenase, with as many as five substitutions on one residue. No mutations were present in 2,317 screened historical specimens, suggesting that mutations arose rapidly through de novo substitutions or from very rare segregating mutations. Identical mutations recurrently appeared in different genetic backgrounds, increasing the likelihood of resistance evolution. The high number of mutational options available for the evolution of target site resistance in this pest challenges resistance management practices.","Cao, Li-Jun; Chen, Jin-Cui; Thia, Joshua A; Schmidt, Thomas L; Ffrench-Constant, Richard; Zhang, Lin-Xi; Yang, Yu; Yuan, Meng-Chu; Zhang, Jia-Yue; Zhang, Xiao-Yang; Yang, Qiong; Gong, Ya-Jun; Li, Hu; Chen, Xuexin; Hoffmann, Ary A; Wei, Shu-Jun","College of Plant Science and Technology, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beijing, China.; Biosciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom.; Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China.; Hebei North University, College of Agriculture and Forestry Technology, Zhangjiakou, China.; Department of Entomology, College of Plant Protection, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.; Institute of Insect Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Bio21 Institute, School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.",eLife,Elife,"Animals, Tetranychidae, Mutation, Evolution, Molecular, Drug Resistance, Acaricides, Insecticide Resistance",2025,08,11,2025,08,13,2023YFD1401200_NONE_National Key Research and Development Program of China_; QNJJ202006_NONE_Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences_; JKZX202208_NONE_Program of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40788297,10.7554/eLife.106288,40788297,1,,[40788297]
40891666,Gene expression variation across genetically identical individuals predicts reproductive traits.,"In recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been the major approach to understand the biological basis of individual differences in traits and diseases. However, GWAS approaches have limited predictive power to explain individual differences, particularly for complex traits and diseases in which environmental factors play a substantial role in their etiology. Indeed, individual differences persist even in genetically identical individuals, although fully separating genetic and environmental causation is difficult in most organisms. To understand the basis of individual differences in the absence of genetic differences, we measured two quantitative reproductive traits in 180 genetically identical young adult <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> roundworms in a shared environment and performed single-individual transcriptomics on each worm. We identified hundreds of genes for which expression variation was strongly associated with reproductive traits, some of which depended on individuals' historical environments and some of which was random. Multiple small sets of genes together were highly predictive of reproductive traits, explaining on average over half and over a quarter of variation in the two traits. We manipulated mRNA levels of predictive genes to identify a set of causal genes, demonstrating the utility of this approach for both prediction and understanding underlying biology. Finally, we found that the chromatin environment of predictive genes was enriched for H3K27 trimethylation, suggesting that gene expression variation may be driven in part by chromatin structure. Together, this work shows that individual, non-genetic differences in gene expression are both highly predictive and causal in shaping reproductive traits.","Webster, Amy K; Willis, John H; Johnson, Erik; Sarkies, Peter; Phillips, Patrick C","Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon, Eugene, United States.; Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, United States.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.",eLife,Elife,"Animals, Caenorhabditis elegans, Reproduction, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genetic Variation, Transcriptome",2025,09,02,2025,09,05,F32 GM146402_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R35GM131838_NH_NIH HHS_United States; F32GM146402_NH_NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM131838_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40891666,10.7554/eLife.106525,40891666,0,0,NONE
40900148,WRN and WRNIP1 ATPases impose high fidelity on translesion synthesis by Y-family DNA polymerases.,"Y-family DNA polymerases (Pols) are intrinsically highly error-prone; yet they conduct predominantly error-free translesion synthesis (TLS) in normal human cells. In response to DNA damage, Y-family Pols assemble and function together with WRN, WRNIP1, and Rev1 in TLS. Among these proteins, WRN possesses a 3'→5' exonuclease activity and an ATPase/3'→5' DNA helicase activity, and WRNIP1 has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. In a previous study, we identified a role of WRN 3'→5' exonuclease activity in the high in vivo fidelity of TLS by Y-family Pols. Here we provide evidence for a crucial role of WRN and WRNIP1 ATPase activities in raising the fidelity of TLS by these Pols. Defects in WRN and WRNIP1 ATPase activities cause a diversity of nucleotide (nt) misincorporations opposite DNA lesions by Y-family Pols, implicating an unprecedented role of these activities in restraining nt misincorporations, which they could accomplish by tightening the active site of the TLS Pol. Altogether, the combined actions of WRN and WRNIP1 ATPases in preventing nt misincorporations and of WRN exonuclease in removing misinserted nts confer such an enormous rise in the fidelity of Y-family Pols that they perform error-free TLS - essential for genome stability and cellular homeostasis.","Yoon, Jung Hoon; Sellamuthu, Karthi; Prakash, Louise; Prakash, Satya","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, United States.",eLife,Elife,"Humans, Werner Syndrome Helicase, DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, Adenosine Triphosphatases, DNA Replication, RecQ Helicases, Translesion DNA Synthesis, DNA-Binding Proteins",2025,09,03,2025,09,06,R35 GM148364_GM_NIGMS NIH HHS_United States; R35 GM148364_NH_NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40900148,10.7554/eLife.106934,40900148,0,0,NONE
40864167,<i>ZC3H11A</i> mutations cause high myopia by triggering PI3K-AKT and NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway in humans and mice.,"High myopia (HM) is a severe form of refractive error that results in irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. However, the genetic and pathological mechanisms underlying this condition are not yet fully understood. From a cohort of 1015 patients with HM in adolescents, likely pathogenic missense mutations were identified in the <i>ZC3H11A</i> gene in four patients by whole exome sequencing. This gene is a zinc finger and stress-induced protein that plays a significant role in regulating nuclear mRNA export. To better understand the function and molecular pathogenesis of myopia in relation to gene mutations, a <i>Zc3h11a</i> knockout (KO) mouse model was created. The <i>Zc3h11a<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice exhibited significant shifts in refraction toward myopia. Myopia-related factors, including <i>Tgfβ1, Mmp2,</i> and <i>Il6,</i> were found to be upregulated in the retina or sclera, and electroretinography and immunofluorescence staining results showed dysfunction and reduced number of bipolar cells in the retina. Transmission electron microscopy findings suggest ultrastructural abnormalities of the retina and sclera. Retinal transcriptome sequencing showed that 769 genes were differentially expressed, and <i>Zc3h11a</i> was found to have a negative impact on the PI3K-AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways by quantitative PCR and western blotting. In summary, this study characterized a new candidate pathogenic gene associated with HM and indicated that the ZC3H11A protein may serve as a stress-induced nuclear response trigger, and its abnormality causes disturbances in a series of inflammatory and myopic factors. These findings offer potential therapeutic intervention targets for controlling the development of HM.","Chen, Chong; Liu, Qian; Tang, Cheng; Rong, Yu; Zhao, Xinyi; Li, Dandan; Lu, Fan; Qu, Jia; Liu, Xinting","National Engineering Research Center of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Optometry and Visual Science, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.; National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.",eLife,Elife,"Animals, Humans, NF-kappa B, Signal Transduction, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Myopia, Mice, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, Mice, Knockout, Adolescent, Male, Female, Disease Models, Animal, Mutation, Retina",2025,08,27,2025,08,29,2023KY151_NONE_Health Technology Plan Project in Zhejiang Province_; 82101176_NONE_National Natural Science Foundation of China_; Y20220774_NONE_Science and Technology Project of Wenzhou_; LTGD23H120002_NONE_Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province_,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40864167,10.7554/eLife.91289,40864167,0,0,NONE
40862571,"Heterozygous variants in <i>PLCG1</i> affect hearing, vision, cardiac, and immune function.","Phospholipase C isozymes (PLCs) hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG), important signaling molecules involved in many cellular processes including Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). <i>PLCG1</i> encodes the PLCγ1 isozyme that is broadly expressed. Hyperactive somatic mutations of <i>PLCG1</i> are observed in multiple cancers, but only one germline variant has been reported. Here, we describe seven individuals with heterozygous missense variants in <i>PLCG1</i> [p.(Asp1019Gly), p.(His380Arg), p.(Asp1165Gly), and p.(Leu597Phe)] who present with hearing impairment (5/7), ocular pathology (4/7), cardiac septal defects (3/6), and various immunological issues (5/7). To model these variants <i>in vivo</i>, we generated the analogous variants in the Drosophila ortholog, <i>small wing</i> (<i>sl</i>). We created a null allele <i>sl<sup>T2A</sup></i> and assessed its expression pattern. <i>sl</i> is broadly expressed, including wing discs, eye discs, and a subset of neurons and glia. <i>sl<sup>T2A</sup></i> mutant flies exhibit wing size reductions, ectopic wing veins, and supernumerary photoreceptors. We document that mutant flies also exhibit a reduced lifespan and age-dependent locomotor defects. Expressing wild-type <i>sl</i> in <i>sl<sup>T2A</sup></i> mutant flies rescues the loss-of-function phenotypes, whereas the variants increase lethality. Ectopic expression of an established hyperactive <i>PLCG1</i> variant, p.(Asp1165His) in the wing pouch causes elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and severe wing phenotypes. These phenotypes are also observed when the p.(Asp1019Gly) or p.(Asp1165Gly) variants are overexpressed in the wing pouch, arguing that these are gain-of-function variants. However, the wing phenotypes associated with p.(His380Arg) or p.(Leu597Phe) overexpression are either mild or only partially penetrant.

40875449,NAB2-STAT6 drives an EGR1-dependent neuroendocrine program in solitary fibrous tumors.,"The pathogenesis of many rare tumor types is poorly understood, preventing the design of effective treatments. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are neoplasms of mesenchymal origin that affect 1/1,000,000 individuals every year and are clinically assimilated to soft tissue sarcomas. SFTs can arise throughout the body and are usually managed surgically. However, 30-40% of SFTs will relapse local-regionally or metastasize. There are no systemic therapies with durable activity for malignant SFTs to date. The molecular hallmark of SFTs is a gene fusion between the <i>NAB2</i> and <i>STAT6</i> loci on chromosome 12, resulting in a chimeric protein of poorly characterized function called NAB2-STAT6. We use primary samples and an inducible cell model to discover that NAB2-STAT6 operates as a transcriptional coactivator for a specific set of enhancers and promoters that are normally targeted by the EGR1 transcription factor. In physiological conditions, NAB2 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm and only a small nuclear fraction is available to operate as a co-activator of EGR1 targets. NAB2-STAT6 redirects NAB1, NAB2, and additional EGR1 to the nucleus and bolsters the expression of neuronal EGR1 targets. The STAT6 moiety of the fusion protein is a major driver of its nuclear localization and further contributes to NAB2's co-activating abilities. In primary tumors, NAB2-STAT6 activates a neuroendocrine gene signature that sets it apart from most sarcomas. These discoveries provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SFTs and reveal new targets with therapeutic potential.","Hill, Connor; Indeglia, Alexandra; Picone, Francis; Murphy, Maureen E; Cipriano, Cara; Maki, Robert G; Gardini, Alessandro","Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States.; The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, United States.; Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States.; Graduate Group in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States.",eLife,Elife,"STAT6 Transcription Factor, Humans, Solitary Fibrous Tumors, Repressor Proteins, Early Growth Response Protein 1, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Cell Line, Tumor",2025,08,28,2025,09,02,CA265257_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; F31 CA265257_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 HL141326_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; HL141326_HL_NHLBI NIH HHS_United States; P30 CA010815_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; R01 CA252223_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States; CA252223_CA_NCI NIH HHS_United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40875449,10.7554/eLife.98072,,,,
40827204,Topology-aware pathway analysis of spatial transcriptomics.,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has transformed genomics by mapping gene expression onto intact tissue architecture, uncovering intricate cellular interactions that bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing often overlook. Traditional ST workflows typically involve clustering spots, performing differential expression analyses, and annotating results <i>via</i> gene-set methods such as overrepresentation analysis (ORA) or gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). More recent spatially-aware techniques extend these approaches by incorporating tissue organization into gene-set scoring. However, because they operate primarily at the level of individual genes, they may overlook the connectivity and topology of biological pathways, limiting their capacity to trace the propagation of signaling events within tissue regions. In this study, we address that gap by translating gene expression into pathway-level activity using the Pathway Signal Flow (PSF) algorithm. PSF integrates expression data with curated interaction networks to compute numeric activity scores for each branch of a biological pathway, producing a functionally annotated feature space that captures downstream signaling effects as branch-specific activity values. We applied PSF to two public 10x Genomics Visium datasets (human melanoma and mouse brain) and compared clustering based on PSF-derived pathway activities from 40 curated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathways and gene expression with standard Seurat Louvain clustering and spatially aware methods (Vesalius, spatialGE). We observed good correspondence between PSF-based and expression-based clustering when spatially aware clustering methods were used. This suggests that branch-level pathway activities can themselves drive clustering and pinpoint spatially deregulated processes. To assess cluster-specific functional annotation, we compared PSF results to conventional ORA (based on marker genes) and GSDensity (based on cluster-specific gene sets). PSF identified a broader set of significant pathways with substantial overlap with both ORA and GSDensity, providing increased sensitivity due to its branch-level resolution. We further demonstrated that PSF-derived activity values can be used to detect spatially deregulated pathway branches, yielding results comparable to those obtained with spatially aware gene set analysis approaches such as GSDensity and spatialGE. The availability of pathway topology and branch-specific information also enabled the identification of potential intercellular communication <i>via</i> ligand-receptor interactions between deregulated pathways in adjacent tumor regions. To support interactive exploration of results, we developed the PSF Spatial Browser, an R Shiny application for visualizing pathway activities, gene expression patterns, and deregulated pathway networks.","Hakobyan, Siras; Schmidt, Maria; Binder, Hans; Arakelyan, Arsen","Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics, Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Saxony, Germany.; Armenian Bioinformatics Institute, Yerevan, Armenia.; Bioinformatics Group, Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia.; Bioengineering, Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology, Russian-Armenian University, Institute of Biomedicine and Pharmacy, Yerevan, Armenia.",PeerJ,PeerJ,"Humans, Mice, Animals, Gene Expression Profiling, Transcriptome, Signal Transduction, Algorithms, Melanoma, Brain, Cluster Analysis",2025,08,14,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40827204,10.7717/peerj.19729,40827204,0,,
40837928,Expression of Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 2 (ASCT2) and L-type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1) in Low-Grade and High-Grade Gliomas: An Analysis of Open-Access Immunohistochemical Data.," The amino acid transporters alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) are the primary transporters of essential amino acids in cancer. ASCT2 and LAT1 are overexpressed in solid tumors and have been associated with poor survival. These transporters may hold prognostic significance and offer potential theranostic utility in the treatment of glioma. The aims of this study are twofold: (1) to determine whether ASCT2 and LAT1 mRNA expression are related to glioma grade and survival; and (2) to characterize ASCT2 and LAT1 expression in low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG).  Survival and mRNA expression data for both ASCT2 and LAT1 were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), accessed via the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal. GraphPad Prism was used to conduct a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Immunohistochemistry images were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and analyzed with QuPath for ASCT2 and LAT1 expression in the cytoplasm and at the endothelium.  Query of TCGA resulted in 49 samples from 28 patients, which were evaluated for ASCT2 and LAT1 expression. Cytoplasmic staining of mRNA for ASCT2 and LAT1 was not associated with glioma grade or survival. Higher mRNA expression of ASCT2 correlated with worse survival (p=0.002) in LGG but not in HGG. mRNA expression of LAT1 did not have any prognostic value. QuPath analysis of samples from the HPA showed increased staining for both ASCT2 and LAT1 at the endothelium in both LGG and HGG. Endothelial expression of ASCT2 and LAT1 correlated with glioma grade.  In our small study conducted with open-access data, ASCT2 and LAT1 did not appear to have prognostic value. However, both ASCT2 and LAT1 staining were increased at the endothelium compared to normal brain tissue. These amino acid transporters may play an important role in tumor proliferation and support theranostic approaches to glioma.","Han, William T; Cheng, Nina; Muhammad, Najib; Lee, John Y K","Department of Neurosurgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.",Cureus,Cureus,,2025,07,19,2025,09,14,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40837928,10.7759/cureus.88325,40837928,0,0,NONE
40895662,Knowledge and Attitudes of Nurses Toward Genetics and Genomics: A Scoping Review.,"Over the past two decades, genetics and genomics have emerged as a pivotal force in medicine and, consequently, healthcare systems. As the largest group of healthcare providers, nurses are essential in integrating genetics/genomics into clinical practice. Nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward genetics and genomics significantly influence their ability to integrate genetic/genomic principles into clinical practice. The aim of this review was to identify existing literature and map key findings on attitudes and knowledge of nurses regarding genetics and genomics. A scoping review of the literature published between 2013 and 2023 was conducted, encompassing four databases. A total of 1761 records were screened, and 49 studies met the inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were applied to summarize the studies' characteristics and findings. The majority of the eligible studies focus on nurses' knowledge, both general and domain-specific, in genetics and genomics, while fewer studies focus specifically on attitudes. Less than a quarter of the studies (22.45%) were interventional. Findings revealed that basic knowledge among nurses was consistently low, often accompanied by misconceptions and a limited understanding of genetics. Studies that incorporated educational interventions demonstrated an increase in knowledge and a positive shift in attitudes. Findings indicate that structured education in interventional studies improves nurses' knowledge and attitudes. These strategies have the potential to advance genomic competency among nurses and ultimately improve patient outcomes. This scoping review demonstrated that the subject remains under-researched, pointing to a significant gap for future research.","Mintzaridis, Konstantinos; Dousis, Evangelos; Evangelou, Eleni; Polikandrioti, Maria; Koutelekos, Ioannis","Department of Nursing, University of West Attica, Athens, GRC.",Cureus,Cureus,,2025,08,28,2025,09,15,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40895662,10.7759/cureus.91196,40895662,0,0,NONE
40917916,Genetics of Congenital Heart Disease: A Narrative Review of Challenges and Strategies in Identifying Novel Genes.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital anomaly. While surgical and interventional advancements have improved survival, the management of associated complications and comorbidities remains complex and would benefit from a personalised approach that more accurately predicts individualised risks and prognoses. Recently, next-generation sequencing has uncovered diverse genetic factors, including epigenetic modifications, somatic mosaicism and regulatory non-coding variants. Despite these advances, challenges persist in translating genomic data into clinical risk prediction and therapeutic guidance. Experimental approaches, such as patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and single-cell sequencing, offer promising preclinical models for interpreting novel variants. Integrating genomic insights into clinical practice requires multidisciplinary team collaboration. The clinicians need to keep themselves abreast with current genomic advancements to optimise customised, individualised care to improve future outcomes for patients with CHD. We aim to provide an overview of the advances in genomic technologies linking the genetics of cardiac development with the pathogenesis of CHD for a better understanding of molecular-morphological correlation.","Rao, Eteesha; Annavarapu, Srinivas","Department of Medical Education, Newcastle University, Newcastle, GBR.; Department of Paediatric Histopathology, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, GBR.",Cureus,Cureus,,2025,09,05,2025,09,10,['NONE'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40917916,10.7759/cureus.91674,40917916,0,0,NONE
