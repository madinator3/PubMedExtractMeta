35759653,Early human B cell signatures of the primary antibody response to mRNA vaccination.,"Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are highly effective at inducing protective immunity. However, weak antibody responses are seen in some individuals, and cellular correlates of immunity remain poorly defined, especially for B cells. Here we used unbiased approaches to longitudinally dissect primary antibody, plasmablast, and memory B cell (MBC) responses to the two-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine in SARS-CoV-2-naive adults. Coordinated immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody responses were preceded by bursts of spike-specific plasmablasts after both doses but earlier and more intensely after dose 2. While antibody and B cell cellular responses were generally robust, they also varied within the cohort and decreased over time after a dose-2 peak. Both antigen-nonspecific postvaccination plasmablast frequency after dose 1 and their spike-specific counterparts early after dose 2 correlated with subsequent antibody levels. This correlation between early plasmablasts and antibodies remained for titers measured at 6 months after vaccination. Several distinct antigen-specific MBC populations emerged postvaccination with varying kinetics, including two MBC populations that correlated with 2- and 6-month antibody titers. Both were IgG-expressing MBCs: one less mature, appearing as a correlate after the first dose, while the other MBC correlate showed a more mature and resting phenotype, emerging as a correlate later after dose 2. This latter MBC was also a major contributor to the sustained spike-specific MBC response observed at month 6. Thus, these plasmablasts and MBCs that emerged after both the first and second doses with distinct kinetics are potential determinants of the magnitude and durability of antibodies in response to mRNA-based vaccination.","Kardava Lela, Rachmaninoff Nicholas, Lau William W, Buckner Clarisa M, Trihemasava Krittin, Blazkova Jana, Lopes de Assis Felipe, Wang Wei, Zhang Xiaozhen, Wang Yimeng, Chiang Chi-I, Narpala Sandeep, McCormack Genevieve E, Liu Can, Seamon Catherine A, Sneller Michael C, O'Connell Sarah, Li Yuxing, McDermott Adrian B, Chun Tae-Wook, Fauci Anthony S, Tsang John S, Moir Susan","Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.; Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, Rockville, MD 20850.; Multiscale Systems Biology Section, Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.; Critical Care Medicine Department, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273, Antibody Formation, B-Lymphocytes, COVID-19, Humans, Immunity, Cellular, Immunoglobulin A, Immunoglobulin G, RNA, Messenger, SARS-CoV-2, Vaccination",2022,06,27,2024,12,05,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35759653,10.1073/pnas.2204607119
34887575,A multiclade env-gag VLP mRNA vaccine elicits tier-2 HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies and reduces the risk of heterologous SHIV infection in macaques.,"The development of a protective vaccine remains a top priority for the control of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Here, we show that a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine co-expressing membrane-anchored HIV-1 envelope (Env) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag proteins to generate virus-like particles (VLPs) induces antibodies capable of broad neutralization and reduces the risk of infection in rhesus macaques. In mice, immunization with co-formulated env and gag mRNAs was superior to env mRNA alone in inducing neutralizing antibodies. Macaques were primed with a transmitted-founder clade-B env mRNA lacking the N276 glycan, followed by multiple booster immunizations with glycan-repaired autologous and subsequently bivalent heterologous envs (clades A and C). This regimen was highly immunogenic and elicited neutralizing antibodies against the most prevalent (tier-2) HIV-1 strains accompanied by robust anti-Env CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Vaccinated animals had a 79% per-exposure risk reduction upon repeated low-dose mucosal challenges with heterologous tier-2 simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV AD8). Thus, the multiclade env-gag VLP mRNA platform represents a promising approach for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine.","Zhang Peng, Narayanan Elisabeth, Liu Qingbo, Tsybovsky Yaroslav, Boswell Kristin, Ding Shilei, Hu Zonghui, Follmann Dean, Lin Yin, Miao Huiyi, Schmeisser Hana, Rogers Denise, Falcone Samantha, Elbashir Sayda M, Presnyak Vladimir, Bahl Kapil, Prabhakaran Madhu, Chen Xuejun, Sarfo Edward K, Ambrozak David R, Gautam Rajeev, Martin Malcom A, Swerczek Joanna, Herbert Richard, Weiss Deborah, Misamore Johnathan, Ciaramella Giuseppe, Himansu Sunny, Stewart-Jones Guillaume, McDermott Adrian, Koup Richard A, Mascola John R, Finzi Andrés, Carfi Andrea, Fauci Anthony S, Lusso Paolo","Bioqual Inc., Rockville, MD, USA.; Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, USA.; Experimental Primate Virology Section, NIAID, Poolesville, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. plusso@niaid.nih.gov.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Biostatistics Research Branch, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Moderna Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.; Université de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.",Nature medicine,Nat Med,"Animals, Antibodies, Neutralizing, Genes, env, Genes, gag, HIV Antibodies, HIV-1, Immunization, Secondary, Macaca mulatta, Risk Factors, Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Vaccines, Synthetic, mRNA Vaccines",2021,12,09,2023,12,13,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34887575,10.1038/s41591-021-01574-5
32029589,Defective HIV-1 proviruses produce viral proteins.,"HIV-1 proviruses persist in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of HIV-infected individuals despite years of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with suppression of HIV-1 RNA levels <40 copies/mL. Greater than 95% of these proviruses detected in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are referred to as ""defective"" by virtue of having large internal deletions and lethal genetic mutations. As these defective proviruses are unable to encode intact and replication-competent viruses, they have long been thought of as biologically irrelevant ""graveyard"" of viruses with little significance to HIV-1 pathogenesis. Contrary to this notion, we have recently demonstrated that these defective proviruses are not silent, are capable of transcribing novel unspliced forms of HIV-RNA transcripts with competent open reading frames (ORFs), and can be found in the peripheral blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of patients at all stages of HIV-1 infection. In the present study, by an approach of combining serial dilutions of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and T cell-cloning technologies, we are able to demonstrate that defective proviruses that persist in HIV-infected individuals during suppressive cART are translationally competent and produce the HIV-1 Gag and Nef proteins. The HIV-RNA transcripts expressed from these defective proviruses may trigger an element of innate immunity. Likewise, the viral proteins coded in the defective proviruses may form extracellular virus-like particles and may trigger immune responses. The persistent production of HIV-1 proteins in the absence of viral replication helps explain persistent immune activation despite HIV-1 levels below detection, and also presents new challenges to HIV-1 eradication.","Imamichi Hiromi, Smith Mindy, Adelsberger Joseph W, Izumi Taisuke, Scrimieri Francesca, Sherman Brad T, Rehm Catherine A, Imamichi Tomozumi, Pau Alice, Catalfamo Marta, Fauci Anthony S, Lane H Clifford","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20057.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; afauci@niaid.nih.gov clane@niaid.nih.gov.; Applied and Developmental Research Directorate, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702.; Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Male, Middle Aged, Proviruses, Viral Proteins",2020,02,06,2020,07,10,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32029589,10.1073/pnas.1917876117

27432972,Defective HIV-1 proviruses produce novel protein-coding RNA species in HIV-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy.,"Despite years of plasma HIV-RNA levels <40 copies per milliliter during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the majority of HIV-infected patients exhibit persistent seropositivity to HIV-1 and evidence of immune activation. These patients also show persistence of proviruses of HIV-1 in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Many of these proviruses have been characterized as defective and thus thought to contribute little to HIV-1 pathogenesis. By combining 5'LTR-to-3'LTR single-genome amplification and direct amplicon sequencing, we have identified the presence of ""defective"" proviruses capable of transcribing novel unspliced HIV-RNA (usHIV-RNA) species in patients at all stages of HIV-1 infection. Although these novel usHIV-RNA transcripts had exon structures that were different from those of the known spliced HIV-RNA variants, they maintained translationally competent ORFs, involving elements of gag, pol, env, rev, and nef to encode a series of novel HIV-1 chimeric proteins. These novel usHIV-RNAs were detected in five of five patients, including four of four patients with prolonged viral suppression of HIV-RNA levels <40 copies per milliliter for more than 6 y. Our findings suggest that the persistent defective proviruses of HIV-1 are not ""silent,"" but rather may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by stimulating host-defense pathways that target foreign nucleic acids and proteins.","Imamichi Hiromi, Dewar Robin L, Adelsberger Joseph W, Rehm Catherine A, O'Doherty Una, Paxinos Ellen E, Fauci Anthony S, Lane H Clifford","Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; afauci@niaid.nih.gov.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104;; Clinical Services Program, Applied and Development Research Directorate, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD 21072;; Applications and Collaborations, Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA 94025.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Anti-Retroviral Agents, DNA, Viral, Gene Expression Regulation, Viral, HIV Infections, HIV-1, Humans, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Proviruses, RNA, Viral, Viral Proteins",2016,07,18,2025,05,29,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27432972,10.1073/pnas.1609057113

Several patients have been medically evacuated to hospitals in the United States and Europe. Detailed clinical data are limited on the clinical course and management of patients with EVD outside western Africa.

First imported EVD case identified in the United States and 2 secondary EVD cases acquired in the United States in critical care nurses who cared for the index case patient. Clinical recovery, EBOV RNA level, resolution of Ebola viremia, survival with discharge from hospital, or death. The index patient had high EBOV RNA levels, developed respiratory and renal failure requiring critical care support, and died. Both patients with secondary EBOV infection had nonspecific signs and symptoms and developed moderate illness; EBOV RNA levels were moderate, and both patients recovered. Both surviving patients received uncontrolled treatment with multiple investigational agents, including convalescent plasma, which limits generalizability of the results. Early diagnosis, prompt initiation of supportive medical care, and moderate clinical illness likely contributed to successful outcomes in both survivors. The inability to determine the potential benefit of investigational therapies and the effect of patient-specific factors that may have contributed to less severe illness highlight the need for controlled clinical studies of these interventions, especially in the setting of a high level of supportive medical care.

25706232,Virologic response following combined ledipasvir and sofosbuvir administration in patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infection.,"There is an unmet need for interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To evaluate the rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and adverse events in previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infection following a 12-week treatment of the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Open-label, single-center, phase 2b pilot study of previously untreated, noncirrhotic patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infection conducted at the Clinical Research Center of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, from June 2013 to September 2014. Patients included those receiving antiretroviral therapy with HIV RNA values of 50 copies/mL or fewer and a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 100 cells/mL or greater or patients with untreated HIV infection with a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 500 cells/mL or greater. Serial measurements of safety parameters, virologic and host immune correlates, and adherence were performed. Fifty patients with HCV genotype 1 never before treated for HCV were prescribed a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary study outcome was the proportion of patients with sustained viral response (plasma HCV RNA level <12 IU/mL) 12 weeks after end of treatment. Forty-nine of 50 participants (98% [95% CI, 89% to 100%]) achieved SVR 12 weeks after end of treatment, whereas 1 patient experienced relapse at week 4 following treatment. In the patient with relapse, deep sequencing revealed a resistance associated mutation in the NS5A region conferring resistance to NS5A inhibitors, such as ledipasvir. The most common adverse events were nasal congestion (16% of patients) and myalgia (14%). There were no discontinuations or serious adverse events attributable to study drug. In this open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study enrolling patients co-infected with HCV genotype 1 and HIV, administration of an oral combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks was associated with high rates of SVR after treatment completion. Larger studies that also include patients with cirrhosis and lower CD4 T-cell counts are required to understand if the results of this study generalize to all patients co-infected with HCV and HIV. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01878799.","Osinusi Anu, Townsend Kerry, Kohli Anita, Nelson Amy, Seamon Cassie, Meissner Eric G, Bon Dimitra, Silk Rachel, Gross Chloe, Price Angie, Sajadi Mohammad, Sidharthan Sreetha, Sims Zayani, Herrmann Eva, Hogan John, Teferi Gebeyehu, Talwani Rohit, Proschan Michael, Jenkins Veronica, Kleiner David E, Wood Brad J, Subramanian G Mani, Pang Phillip S, McHutchison John G, Polis Michael A, Fauci Anthony S, Masur Henry, Kottilil Shyam","Division of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore2Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland3Gilead Sciences Inc, F.; Critical Care Medicine Department, NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland5Clinical Research Directorate/Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc (formerly SAIC-Frederick, Inc), Frederick Nationa.; Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Critical Care Medicine Department, NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore2Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Institute of Biostatistics and Mathematical Modeling, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.; Division of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore5Clinical Research Directorate/Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc (formerly SAIC-Frederick, Inc), Frederick National Laborato.; Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City, California.; Unity Health Care Inc, Washington, DC.; Center for Interventional Oncology, Radiology and Imaging Sciences, NIH Clinical Center and National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland6Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine, Charleston.; Department of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.; Family and Medical Counseling Services, Washington, DC.",JAMA,JAMA,"Administration, Oral, Adult, Antiviral Agents, Benzimidazoles, Coinfection, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Fluorenes, Genotype, HIV Infections, Hepacivirus, Hepatitis C, Chronic, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Myalgia, RNA, Viral, Sofosbuvir, Treatment Outcome, Uridine Monophosphate, Viral Load",2016,07,18,2025,05,29,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25706232,10.1001/jama.2015.1373
25591505,Virological response after 6 week triple-drug regimens for hepatitis C: a proof-of-concept phase 2A cohort study.,"Direct-acting antiviral drugs have a high cure rate and favourable tolerability for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Shorter courses could improve affordability and adherence. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir with ribavirin have high efficacy when taken for 8 weeks but not for 6 weeks. We assessed whether the addition of a third direct-acting antiviral drug to sofosbuvir and ledipasvir would allow a shorter treatment duration. In this single-centre, open-label, phase 2A trial, we sequentially enrolled treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 infection into three treatment groups: 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir; 6 weeks of sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS-9669; or 6 weeks of sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS-9451. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the propotion of patients with sustained viral response at 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12), assessed by serum HCV RNA concentrations lower than 43 IU/mL (the lower limit of quantification). We did an intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint and adverse events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01805882. Between Jan 11, 2013, and Dec 17, 2013, we enrolled 60 patients, and sequentially assigned them into three groups of 20. We noted an SVR12 in all 20 patients (100%, 95% CI 83-100) allocated to sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 12 weeks; in 19 (95%, 75-100) of the 20 patients allocated to sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS-9669 for 6 weeks (one patient relapsed 2 weeks after completion of treatment); and in 19 (95%, 75-100%) of the 20 patients allocated to sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS-9451 for 6 weeks (one patient was lost to follow-up after reaching sustained viral response at 4 weeks). Most adverse events were mild and no patients discontinued treatment. Two serious adverse events occurred (pain after a post-treatment liver biopsy and vertigo), both unrelated to study drugs. In this small proof-of-concept study, two different three-drug regimens that were given for 6 weeks resulted in high cure rates for HCV infection with excellent tolerability. Addition of a third potent direct-acting antiviral drug can reduce the duration of treatment required to achieve sustained viral response in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis.

23520522,Identification of human microRNA-like sequences embedded within the protein-encoding genes of the human immunodeficiency virus.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, short (18-22 nts), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of mRNAs. While numerous cellular microRNAs have been associated with the progression of various diseases including cancer, miRNAs associated with retroviruses have not been well characterized. Herein we report identification of microRNA-like sequences in coding regions of several HIV-1 genomes. Based on our earlier proteomics and bioinformatics studies, we have identified 8 cellular miRNAs that are predicted to bind to the mRNAs of multiple proteins that are dysregulated during HIV-infection of CD4+ T-cells in vitro. In silico analysis of the full length and mature sequences of these 8 miRNAs and comparisons with all the genomic and subgenomic sequences of HIV-1 strains in global databases revealed that the first 18/18 sequences of the mature hsa-miR-195 sequence (including the short seed sequence), matched perfectly (100%), or with one nucleotide mismatch, within the envelope (env) genes of five HIV-1 genomes from Africa. In addition, we have identified 4 other miRNA-like sequences (hsa-miR-30d, hsa-miR-30e, hsa-miR-374a and hsa-miR-424) within the env and the gag-pol encoding regions of several HIV-1 strains, albeit with reduced homology. Mapping of the miRNA-homologues of env within HIV-1 genomes localized these sequence to the functionally significant variable regions of the env glycoprotein gp120 designated V1, V2, V4 and V5. We conclude that microRNA-like sequences are embedded within the protein-encoding regions of several HIV-1 genomes. Given that the V1 to V5 regions of HIV-1 envelopes contain specific, well-characterized domains that are critical for immune responses, virus neutralization and disease progression, we propose that the newly discovered miRNA-like sequences within the HIV-1 genomes may have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading innate immune responses and therefore influencing persistence, replication and/or pathogenicity.","Holland Bryan, Wong Jonathan, Li Meng, Rasheed Suraiya","Laboratory of Viral Oncology and Proteomics Research, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.",PloS one,PLoS One,"Databases, Nucleic Acid, Genome, Viral, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, HIV-1, Humans, MicroRNAs, RNA, Viral",2013,03,08,2021,10,21,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23520522,10.1371/journal.pone.0058586
